In the third week, a 30 mg dose is taken three times daily (1 tablet in the morning, 1 at \nmidday, and 1 in the evening). From the fourth week, treatment is switched to only 1 tablet of \na 120 mg dose in the evening. This dose is then increased by one 120 mg tablet per week at different \ntimes of day for the subsequent 5 weeks, as shown in the table below.  \nThe maximum daily dose allowed is 720 mg (six 120 mg tablets). \nWeek \nNumber of tablets \nTotal daily dose (mg) \nMorning \nMidday \nEvening \nof dimethyl fumarate  \nSkilarence 30 mg \n30 \n60 \n90 \nSkilarence 120 mg \n120 \n240 \n360 \n480 \n600 \n9+ \n720 \nIf a particular dose increase is not tolerated, it may be temporarily reduced to the last tolerated dose. \nIf treatment success is observed before the maximum dose is reached, no further increase of dose is \nnecessary.

It has not been studied in \npatients with pre-existing low leukocyte or lymphocyte counts. \nBefore treatment \nPrior to initiating treatment, a current complete blood count (including differential blood count and \nplatelet count) should be available. Treatment should not be initiated if leukopenia below 3.0x109/L, \nlymphopenia below 1.0x109/L or other pathological results are identified. \nDuring treatment \nDuring treatment, a complete blood count with differential should be performed every 3 months. \nAction is needed in the following circumstances: \nLeukopenia\nIf a marked decrease in the total number of white blood cells is found, the situation should be \nmonitored carefully and treatment should be discontinued at levels below 3.0x109/L. \nLymphopenia\nIf the lymphocyte count falls below 1.0x109/L but is \u2265 0.7 x109/L, blood monitoring should be \nperformed monthly until levels return to 1.0x109/L or higher for two consecutive blood tests at which \npoint monitoring can again be performed every 3 months. \nIf the lymphocyte count falls below 0.7x109/L, the blood test must be repeated and if the levels are \nconfirmed to be below 0.7x109/L, then treatment must be stopped immediately. Patients developing \nlymphopenia should be monitored after stopping treatment until their lymphocyte count has returned \nto the normal range (see section 4.8). \nOther haematological disorders \nTherapy should be discontinued and caution is advised if other pathological results occur. In any case, \nblood counts should be monitored until values have returned to the normal range. \nInfections \nSkilarence is an immunomodulator and may affect the way the immune system responds to infection. \nFor patients with pre-existing infections of clinical relevance, the physician should decide if treatment \nshould only be initiated once the infection has resolved. If a patient develops an infection during \ntreatment, suspension of treatment should be considered and the benefits and risks should be \nreassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving this medicinal product should be \ninstructed to report symptoms of infection to a physician. \nOpportunistic infections/progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nCases of opportunistic infections, particularly of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) \nhave been reported with other dimethyl fumarate-containing products (see section 4.8). PML is an \nopportunistic infection caused by the John-Cunningham virus (JCV) that can be fatal or cause severe \ndisabilities. PML is probably caused by a combination of factors. \nA previous infection with JCV is considered a prerequisite for the development of PML. Risk factors \ncan include previous immunosuppressive treatment and the existence of certain concomitant disorders \n(such as some autoimmune disorders or malignant haematological conditions). A modified or \nweakened immune system as well as genetic or environmental factors can also constitute risk factors. \nPersistent moderate or severe lymphopenia during treatment with dimethyl fumarate is also considered \na risk factor for PML. Patients who develop lymphopenia should be monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of opportunistic infections, particularly for symptoms indicative of PML. Typical \nsymptoms associated with PML are diverse, become worse over days to weeks and include \nprogressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision and \nchanges in thinking, memory and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes. If PML is \nsuspected, treatment should be stopped immediately and further appropriate neurological and \nradiological examinations performed. \nPrior and concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies \nLimited data are available on the efficacy and safety of Skilarence in patients who have been \npreviously treated with other immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies. When switching \npatients from such therapies to Skilarence, the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy should \nbe considered in order to avoid additive effects on the immune system. \nNo data are available on the efficacy and safety of Skilarence when taken concomitantly with other \nimmunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies (see section 4.5). \nPre-existing gastrointestinal disease \nSkilarence has not been studied in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal disease. It is \ncontraindicated in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease (see sections 4.3). Gastrointestinal \ntolerability can be improved by following the dose titration schedule on initiating treatment and by \ntaking the gastro-resistant tablet(s) with food (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). \nRenal function \nDuring the Phase III placebo-controlled clinical study, renal function was not seen to deteriorate \nduring therapy across treatment groups. However, Skilarence has not been studied in patients with \nsevere renal impairment, and some cases of renal toxicity have been reported during post-marketing \nsurveillance with fumaric acid esters. Hence, Skilarence is contraindicated in patients with severe \nrenal impairment (see section 4.3). \nRenal function (e.g. creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) should be checked prior to \ninitiation of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. In the event of a clinically relevant change in \nrenal function, particularly in the absence of alternative explanations, consideration should be given to \ndose reduction or treatment discontinuation. \nFanconi syndrome \nEarly diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome and discontinuation of Skilarence treatment are important to \nprevent the onset of renal impairment and osteomalacia, as the syndrome is usually reversible. The \nmost important signs are: proteinuria, glucosuria (with normal blood sugar levels), \nhyperaminoaciduria and phosphaturia (possibly concurrent with hypophosphatemia) (see section 4.8). \nProgression might involve symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia and proximal muscle weakness. In \nrare cases hypophosphataemic osteomalacia with non-localised bone pain, elevated alkaline \nphosphatase in serum and stress fractures may occur. Importantly, Fanconi syndrome can occur \nwithout elevated creatinine levels or low glomerular filtration rate. In case of unclear symptoms, \nFanconi syndrome should be considered and appropriate examinations should be performed. \nHepatic function \nSkilarence has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in \nthese patients (see section 4.3).  \nIt is recommended to monitor hepatic function (SGOT, SGPT, gamma-GT, AP) prior to initiation of \ntreatment and every 3 months thereafter, since elevation of hepatic enzymes has been observed in \nsome patients in the Phase III study (see section 4.8). In the event of a clinically relevant change in \nhepatic parameters, particularly in the absence of alternative explanations, consideration should be \ngiven to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation (see section 4.2). \nFlushing \nPatients should be made aware that they are likely to experience flushing in the first few weeks of \ntreatment (see section 4.8). \nExcipients \nLactose \nThis medicinal product contains lactose.

Caution should be exercised when prescribing medicinal products \nwith a narrow therapeutic index that require absorption in the intestinal tract. The efficacy of oral \ncontraceptives may be reduced and the use of an alternative barrier contraceptive method is \nrecommended to prevent possible failure of contraception (see the prescribing information of the oral \ncontraceptive). \nConsumption of large quantities of strong alcoholic drinks (more than 30% alcohol by volume) should \nbe avoided because it may lead to increased dissolution rates of Skilarence and, therefore, may \nincrease the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. \nVaccination during treatment with Skilarence has not been studied. Immunosuppression is a risk factor \nfor the use of live vaccines. The risk of vaccination should be weighed against the benefit. \nThere is no evidence for interaction with cytochrome P450 and the most common efflux and uptake \ntransporters, thus no interactions are expected with medicinal products metabolised or transported by \nthese systems (see section 5.2).", "driving": "Women of child-bearing potential \nSkilarence is not recommended in women of child-bearing potential not using appropriate \ncontraception.

Physicians should exercise caution when considering \nthe use of Humira in patients with a history of recurring infection or with underlying conditions which \nmay predispose patients to infections, including the use of concomitant immunosuppressive medications.\nSerious infections\nSerious infections, including sepsis, due to bacterial, mycobacterial, invasive fungal, parasitic, viral, or \nother opportunistic infections such as listeriosis, legionellosis and pneumocystis have been reported in \npatients receiving Humira.  \nOther serious infections seen in clinical trials include pneumonia, pyelonephritis, septic arthritis and \nsepticaemia. Hospitalisation or fatal outcomes associated with infections have been reported. \nTuberculosis\nTuberculosis, including reactivation and new onset of tuberculosis, has been reported in patients receiving \nHumira. Reports included cases of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (i.e. disseminated) tuberculosis. \nBefore initiation of therapy with Humira, all patients must be evaluated for both active or inactive \n(\u201clatent\u201d) tuberculosis infection. This evaluation should include a detailed medical assessment of patient \nhistory of tuberculosis or possible previous exposure to people with active tuberculosis and previous \nand/or current immunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests (i.e. tuberculin skin test and chest \nX-ray) should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct and results of these tests are recorded in the Patient Reminder Card. Prescribers are reminded of \nthe risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised. \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Humira therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3). \nIn all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of therapy should be very carefully considered.\nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted.\nIf latent tuberculosis is diagnosed, appropriate treatment must be started with anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis \ntreatment before the initiation of Humira and in accordance with local recommendations. \nUse of anti-tuberculosis prophylaxis treatment should also be considered before the initiation of Humira in \npatients with several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis despite a negative test for tuberculosis and \nin patients with a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment \ncannot be confirmed.  \nDespite prophylactic treatment for tuberculosis, cases of reactivated tuberculosis have occurred in patients \ntreated with Humira. Some patients who have been successfully treated for active tuberculosis have \nredeveloped tuberculosis while being treated with Humira.\nPatients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of a tuberculosis \ninfection (e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low grade fever, listlessness) occur during or after \ntherapy with Humira. \nOther opportunistic infections\nOpportunistic infections, including invasive fungal infections have been observed in patients receiving \nHumira. These infections have not consistently been recognised in patients taking TNF-antagonists and \nthis has resulted in delays in appropriate treatment, sometimes resulting in fatal outcomes. \nFor patients who develop the signs and symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, \ndyspnoea, and/or pulmonary infiltrates or other serious systemic illness with or without concomitant shock \nan invasive fungal infection should be suspected and administration of Humira should be promptly \ndiscontinued. Diagnosis and administration of empiric antifungal therapy in these patients should be made \nin consultation with a physician with expertise in the care of patients with invasive fungal infections. \nHepatitis B reactivation\nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including Humira, who are \nchronic carriers of this virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients \nshould be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Humira. For patients who test positive \nfor hepatitis B infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of hepatitis B is \nrecommended.\nCarriers of HBV who require treatment with Humira should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms \nof active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months following termination of therapy. \nAdequate data from treating patients who are carriers of HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not available. In patients who develop HBV \nreactivation, Humira should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive \ntreatment should be initiated. \nNeurological events \nTNF-antagonists including Humira have been associated in rare instances with new onset or exacerbation \nof clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system demyelinating disease \nincluding multiple sclerosis and optic neuritis, and peripheral demyelinating disease, including Guillain-\nBarr\u00e9 syndrome. Prescribers should exercise caution in considering the use of Humira in patients with pre-\nexisting or recent-onset central or peripheral nervous system demyelinating disorders; discontinuation of \nHumira should be considered if any of these disorders develop. There is a known association between \nintermediate uveitis and central demyelinating disorders. Neurologic evaluation should be performed in \npatients with non-infectious intermediate uveitis prior to the initiation of Humira therapy and regularly \nduring treatment to assess for pre-existing or developing central demyelinating disorders. \nAllergic reactions\nSerious allergic reactions associated with Humira were rare during clinical trials. Non-serious allergic \nreactions associated with Humira were uncommon during clinical trials. Reports of serious allergic \nreactions including anaphylaxis have been received following Humira administration. If an anaphylactic \nreaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administration of Humira should be discontinued \nimmediately and appropriate therapy initiated. \nImmunosuppression\nIn a study of 64 patients with rheumatoid arthritis that were treated with Humira, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector T-, B-, NK-cells, monocyte/macrophages, and neutrophils.\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of malignancies including \nlymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control \npatients. However, the occurrence was rare. In the post marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma \nand leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates the risk estimation. With the current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of \nlymphomas, leukaemia, and other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be \nexcluded.\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nadalimumab in the post marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated with \nimmunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents treated with \nTNF-antagonists cannot be excluded. \nRare postmarketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been identified in patients treated with \nadalimumab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive disease course and is usually fatal. \nSome of these hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with Humira have occurred in young adult patients on \nconcomitant treatment with azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine used for inflammatory bowel disease. The \npotential risk with the combination of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine and Humira should be carefully \nconsidered. A risk for the development of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated with Humira \ncannot be excluded (see section 4.8).\nNo studies have been conducted that include patients with a history of malignancy or in whom treatment \nwith Humira is continued following development of malignancy. Thus, additional caution should be \nexercised in considering Humira treatment of these patients (see section 4.8).\nAll patients, and in particular patients with a medical history of extensive immunosuppressant therapy or \npsoriasis patients with a history of PUVA treatment should be examined for the presence of non-\nmelanoma skin cancer prior to and during treatment with Humira. Melanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma \nhave also been reported in patients treated with TNF-antagonists including adalimumab (see section 4.8).\nIn an exploratory clinical trial evaluating the use of another TNF-antagonist, infliximab, in patients with \nmoderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies, mostly in the lung \nor head and neck, were reported in infliximab-treated patients compared with control patients. All patients \nhad a history of heavy smoking. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using any TNF-antagonist in \nCOPD patients, as well as in patients with increased risk for malignancy due to heavy smoking.\nWith current data it is not known if adalimumab treatment influences the risk for developing dysplasia or \ncolon cancer. All patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma \n(for example, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had \na prior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals before \ntherapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and biopsies per \nlocal recommendations.\nHaematologic reactions\nRare reports of pancytopenia including aplastic anaemia have been reported with TNF-antagonists.  \nAdverse events of the haematologic system, including medically significant cytopenia (e.g. \nthrombocytopenia, leukopenia) have been reported with Humira. All patients should be advised to seek \nimmediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. \npersistent fever, bruising, bleeding, pallor) while on Humira. Discontinuation of Humira therapy should be \nconsidered in patients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities.\nVaccinations \nSimilar antibody responses to the standard 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza trivalent \nvirus vaccination were observed in a study in 226 adult subjects with rheumatoid arthritis who were \ntreated with adalimumab or placebo. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by \nlive vaccines in patients receiving Humira.  \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Humira therapy.\nPatients on Humira may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines. Administration of live \nvaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for 5 months \nfollowing the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.\nCongestive heart failure\nIn a clinical trial with another TNF-antagonist worsening congestive heart failure and increased mortality \ndue to congestive heart failure have been observed. Cases of worsening congestive heart failure have also \nbeen reported in patients receiving Humira. Humira should be used with caution in patients with mild \nheart failure (NYHA class I/II). Humira is contraindicated in moderate to severe heart failure (see section \n4.3). Treatment with Humira must be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening symptoms \nof congestive heart failure.\nAutoimmune processes\nTreatment with Humira may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies. The impact of long-term \ntreatment with Humira on the development of autoimmune diseases is unknown. If a patient develops \nsymptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following treatment with Humira and is positive for \nantibodies against double-stranded DNA, further treatment with Humira should not be given (see section \n4.8).\nConcurrent administration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\nSerious infections were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and another \nTNF-antagonist, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. Because of the \nnature of the adverse events seen with the combination of etanercept and anakinra therapy, similar \ntoxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF-antagonists. Therefore, the \ncombination of adalimumab and anakinra is not recommended. (See section 4.5).\nConcomitant administration of adalimumab with other biologic DMARDS (e.g, anakinra and abatacept) or \nother TNF-antagonists is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections, \nincluding serious infections and other potential pharmacological interactions. (See section 4.5).\nSurgery\nThere is limited safety experience of surgical procedures in patients treated with Humira. The long half-\nlife of adalimumab should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who \nrequires surgery while on Humira should be closely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions \nshould be taken. There is limited safety experience in patients undergoing arthroplasty while receiving \nHumira. \nSmall bowel obstruction\nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of fixed fibrotic stricture \nthat may require surgical treatment. Available data suggest that Humira does not worsen or cause \nstrictures.\nElderly\nThe frequency of serious infections among Humira treated subjects over 65 years of age (3.7%) was \nhigher than for those under 65 years of age (1.5%). Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention \nregarding the risk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly.\nPaediatric population\nSee Vaccinations above.", "pregnancy": "Humira has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic \narthritis patients taking Humira as monotherapy and those taking concomitant methotrexate. Antibody \nformation was lower when Humira was given together with methotrexate in comparison with use as \nmonotherapy. Administration of Humira without methotrexate resulted in increased formation of \nantibodies, increased clearance and reduced efficacy of adalimumab (see section 5.1). \nThe combination of Humira and anakinra is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent administration \nof biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d). \nThe combination of Humira and abatacept is not recommended (see section 4.4 \u201cConcurrent \nadministration of biologic DMARDS or TNF-antagonists\u201d).", "driving": "Women of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent pregnancy \nand continue its use for at least five months after the last Humira treatment.\nPregnancy\nA large number (approximately 2100) of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to adalimumab \nresulting in live birth with known outcomes, including more than 1500 exposed during the first trimester, \ndoes not indicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn.\nIn a prospective cohort registry, 257 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or Crohn\u2019s disease (CD)\ntreated with adalimumab at least during the first trimester and 120 women with RA or CD not treated with \nadalimumab were enrolled.  The primary endpoint was the birth prevalence of major birth defects. The \nrate of pregnancies ending with at least one live born infant with a major birth defect was 6/69 (8.7%) in \nthe adalimumab-treated women with RA and 5/74 (6.8%) in the untreated women with RA (unadjusted \nOR 1.31, 95% CI 0.38-4.52) and 16/152 (10.5%) in the adalimumab-treated women with CD and 3/32 \n(9.4%) in the untreated women with CD (unadjusted OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.31-4.16). The adjusted OR \n(accounting for baseline differences) was 1.10 (95% CI 0.45-2.73) with RA and CD combined. There were \nno distinct differences between adalimumab-treated and untreated women for the secondary endpoints \nspontaneous abortions, minor birth defects, preterm delivery, birth size and serious or opportunistic \ninfections and no stillbirths or malignancies were reported. The interpretation of data may be impacted due \nto methodological limitations of the study, including small sample size and non-randomized design.\nIn a developmental toxicity study conducted in monkeys, there was no indication of maternal toxicity, \nembryotoxicity or teratogenicity. Preclinical data on postnatal toxicity of adalimumab are not available \n(see section 5.3).\nDue to its inhibition of TNF\n\uf061, adalimumab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn.  Adalimumab should only be used during pregnancy if clearly needed.\nAdalimumab may cross the placenta into the serum of infants born to women treated with adalimumab \nduring pregnancy. Consequently, these infants may be at increased risk for infection. Administration of \nlive vaccines (e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to adalimumab in utero is not recommended for \n5 months following the mother\u2019s last adalimumab injection during pregnancy.\nBreast-feeding\nLimited information from the published literature indicates that adalimumab is excreted in breast milk at \nvery low concentrations with the presence of adalimumab in human milk at concentrations of 0.1% to 1% \nof the maternal serum level. Given orally, immunoglobulin G proteins undergo intestinal proteolysis and \nhave poor bioavailability. No effects on the breastfed newborns/infants are anticipated. Consequently, \nHumira can be used during breastfeeding.\nFertility\nPreclinical data on fertility effects of adalimumab are not available.", "side_effects": "Humira may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Infliximab has been studied only in combination with conventional \nimmunosuppressive therapy. \nUlcerative colitis \nRemsima is indicated for treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adult patients \nwho have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and \n6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant to or have medical \ncontraindications for such therapies. \nPaediatric ulcerative colitis \nRemsima is indicated for treatment of severely active ulcerative colitis in children and adolescents \naged 6 to 17 years, who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy including \ncorticosteroids and 6-MP or AZA, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications for such \ntherapies. \nAnkylosing spondylitis \nRemsima is indicated for treatment of severe, active ankylosing spondylitis, in adult patients who have \nresponded inadequately to conventional therapy. \nPsoriatic arthritis \nRemsima is indicated for treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adult patients when \nthe response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. \nRemsima should be administered: \nin combination with methotrexate \nor alone in patients who show intolerance to methotrexate or for whom methotrexate is \ncontraindicated. \nInfliximab has been shown to improve physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to \nreduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by X-ray in patients with \npolyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1). \nPsoriasis \nRemsima is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who failed \nto respond to, or who have a contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy including \nciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen ultra-violet A (PUVA) (see section 5.1).", "posology": "Remsima treatment is to be initiated and supervised by qualified physicians experienced in the \ndiagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, \npsoriatic arthritis or psoriasis. Remsima should be administered intravenously. Remsima infusions \nshould be administered by qualified healthcare professionals trained to detect any infusion-related \nissues. Patients treated with Remsima should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder \ncard. \nDuring Remsima treatment, other concomitant therapies, e.g. corticosteroids and immunosuppressants \nshould be optimised. \nIt is important to check the product labels to ensure that the correct formulation (intravenous or \nsubcutaneous) is being administered to the patient, as prescribed. Remsima subcutaneous formulation \nis not intended for intravenous administration and should be administered via a subcutaneous injection \nonly. \nPosology \nAdults (\u226518 years)  \nRheumatoid arthritis \n3 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 3 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \nRemsima must be given concomitantly with methotrexate.  \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 12 weeks of treatment. If a \npatient has an inadequate response or loses response after this period, consideration may be given to \nincrease the dose step-wise by approximately 1.5 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 7.5 mg/kg every \n8 weeks. Alternatively, administration of 3 mg/kg as often as every 4 weeks may be considered. If \nadequate response is achieved, patients should be continued on the selected dose or dose frequency. \nContinued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic \nbenefit within the first 12 weeks of treatment or after dose adjustment. \nModerately to severely active Crohn\u2019s disease \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by an additional 5 mg/kg infusion 2 weeks after the \nfirst infusion. If a patient does not respond after 2 doses, no additional treatment with infliximab \nshould be given. Available data do not support further infliximab treatment, in patients not responding \nwithin 6 weeks of the initial infusion. \nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are: \nMaintenance: Additional infusion of 5 mg/kg at 6 weeks after the initial dose, followed by \ninfusions every 8 weeks or \nRe-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur (see \n\u2018Re-administration\u2019 below and section 4.4). \nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg but \nwho lost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see \nsection 5.1). Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit after dose adjustment. \nFistulising, active Crohn\u2019s disease \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusions at 2 and 6 weeks \nafter the first infusion. If a patient does not respond after 3 doses, no additional treatment with \ninfliximab should be given. \nIn responding patients, the alternative strategies for continued treatment are: \nMaintenance: Additional infusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks or \nRe-administration: Infusion of 5 mg/kg if signs and symptoms of the disease recur followed by \ninfusions of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks (see \u2018Re-administration\u2019 below and section 4.4). \nAlthough comparative data are lacking, limited data in patients who initially responded to 5 mg/kg but \nwho lost response indicate that some patients may regain response with dose escalation (see \nsection 5.1). Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit after dose adjustment. \nIn Crohn\u2019s disease, experience with re-administration if signs and symptoms of disease recur is limited \nand comparative data on the benefit/risk of the alternative strategies for continued treatment are \nlacking. \nUlcerative colitis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \nAvailable data suggest that the clinical response is usually achieved within 14 weeks of treatment, i.e. \nthree doses. Continued therapy should be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of \ntherapeutic benefit within this time period. \nAnkylosing spondylitis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 6 to 8 weeks. If a patient does not respond by 6 weeks (i.e. \nafter 2 doses), no additional treatment with infliximab should be given. \nPsoriatic arthritis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. \nPsoriasis \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. If a patient shows no response after \n14 weeks (i.e. after 4 doses), no additional treatment with infliximab should be given. \nRe-administration for Crohn\u2019s disease and rheumatoid arthritis \nIf the signs and symptoms of disease recur, infliximab can be re-administered within 16 weeks \nfollowing the last infusion. In clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been uncommon \nand have occurred after infliximab-free intervals of less than 1 year (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The \nsafety and efficacy of re-administration after an infliximab-free interval of more than 16 weeks has not \nbeen established. This applies to both Crohn\u2019s disease patients and rheumatoid arthritis patients. \nRe-administration for ulcerative colitis \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \nRe-administration for ankylosing spondylitis \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 6 to 8 weeks, has not been established \n(see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \nRe-administration for psoriatic arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of re-administration, other than every 8 weeks, has not been established (see \nsections 4.4 and 4.8). \nRe-administration for psoriasis \nLimited experience from re-treatment with one single infliximab dose in psoriasis after an interval of \n20 weeks suggests reduced efficacy and a higher incidence of mild to moderate infusion reactions \nwhen compared to the initial induction regimen (see section 5.1). \nLimited experience from re-treatment following disease flare by a re-induction regimen suggests a \nhigher incidence of infusion reactions, including serious ones, when compared to 8-weekly \nmaintenance treatment (see section 4.8). \nRe-administration across indications \nIn case maintenance therapy is interrupted, and there is a need to restart treatment, use of a \nre-induction regimen is not recommended (see section 4.8). In this situation, infliximab should be \nre-initiated as a single dose followed by the maintenance dose recommendations described above. \nSpecial populations \nElderly \nSpecific studies of infliximab in elderly patients have not been conducted. No major age-related \ndifferences in clearance or volume of distribution were observed in clinical studies. No dose \nadjustment is required (see section 5.2). For more information about the safety of infliximab in elderly \npatients (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). \nRenal and/or hepatic impairment \nInfliximab has not been studied in these patient populations.

Available data do not support further \ninfliximab treatment in children and adolescents not responding within the first 10 weeks of treatment \n(see section 5.1). \nSome patients may require a shorter dosing interval to maintain clinical benefit, while for others a \nlonger dosing interval may be sufficient. Patients who have had their dose interval shortened to less \nthan 8 weeks may be at greater risk for adverse reactions. Continued therapy with a shortened interval \nshould be carefully considered in those patients who show no evidence of additional therapeutic \nbenefit after a change in dosing interval. \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab have not been studied in children with Crohn\u2019s disease below the \nage of 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made in children younger than 6 years. \nUlcerative colitis (6 to 17 years) \n5 mg/kg given as an intravenous infusion followed by additional 5 mg/kg infusion doses at 2 and \n6 weeks after the first infusion, then every 8 weeks thereafter. Available data do not support further \ninfliximab treatment in paediatric patients not responding within the first 8 weeks of treatment (see \nsection 5.1). \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab have not been studied in children with ulcerative colitis below \nthe age of 6 years. Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2 but no \nrecommendation on a posology can be made in children younger than 6 years. \nPsoriasis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindication of psoriasis have not been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 \nbut no recommendation on a posology can be made. \nJuvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindications of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis have not been \nestablished. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a \nposology can be made. \nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis \nThe safety and efficacy of infliximab in children and adolescents younger than 18 years for the \nindication of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis have not been established. Currently available data are \ndescribed in sections 4.8 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. \nMethod of administration \nInfliximab should be administered intravenously over a 2 hour period. All patients administered \ninfliximab are to be observed for at least 1-2 hours post-infusion for acute infusion-related reactions. \nEmergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids and an artificial airway must \nbe available. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, hydrocortisone and/or \nparacetamol and infusion rate may be slowed in order to decrease the risk of infusion-related reactions \nespecially if infusion-related reactions have occurred previously (see section 4.4). \nShortened infusions across adult indications \nIn carefully selected adult patients who have tolerated at least 3 initial 2-hour infusions of infliximab \n(induction phase) and are receiving maintenance therapy, consideration may be given to administering \nsubsequent infusions over a period of not less than 1 hour. If an infusion reaction occurs in association \nwith a shortened infusion, a slower infusion rate may be considered for future infusions if treatment is \nto be continued. Shortened infusions at doses >6 mg/kg have not been studied (see section 4.8). \nFor preparation and administration instructions, see section 6.6.", "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance, to other murine proteins, or to any of the excipients listed in \nsection 6.1. \nPatients with tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis, abscesses, and opportunistic \ninfections (see section 4.4). \nPatients with moderate or severe heart failure (NYHA class III/IV) (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).", "special_warnings": "Traceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the tradename and the batch \nnumber of the administered product should be clearly recorded. \nInfusion reactions and hypersensitivity \nInfliximab has been associated with acute infusion-related reactions, including anaphylactic shock, \nand delayed hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). \nAcute infusion reactions including anaphylactic reactions may develop during (within seconds) or \nwithin a few hours following infusion. If acute infusion reactions occur, the infusion must be \ninterrupted immediately. Emergency equipment, such as adrenaline, antihistamines, corticosteroids \nand an artificial airway must be available. Patients may be pre-treated with e.g., an antihistamine, \nhydrocortisone and/or paracetamol to prevent mild and transient effects. \nAntibodies to infliximab may develop and have been associated with an increased frequency of \ninfusion reactions. A low proportion of the infusion reactions was serious allergic reactions. An \nassociation between development of antibodies to infliximab and reduced duration of response has \nalso been observed. Concomitant administration of immunomodulators has been associated with lower \nincidence of antibodies to infliximab and a reduction in the frequency of infusion reactions. The effect \nof concomitant immunomodulator therapy was more profound in episodically-treated patients than in \npatients given maintenance therapy. Patients who discontinue immunosuppressants prior to or during \ninfliximab treatment are at greater risk of developing these antibodies. Antibodies to infliximab cannot \nalways be detected in serum samples. If serious reactions occur, symptomatic treatment must be given \nand further infliximab infusions must not be administered (see section 4.8). \nIn clinical studies, delayed hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Available data suggest an \nincreased risk for delayed hypersensitivity with increasing infliximab-free interval. Patients should be \nadvised to seek immediate medical advice if they experience any delayed adverse reaction (see section \n4.8). If patients are re-treated after a prolonged period, they must be closely monitored for signs and \nsymptoms of delayed hypersensitivity. \nInfections \nPatients must be monitored closely for infections including tuberculosis before, during and after \ntreatment with infliximab. Because the elimination of infliximab may take up to six months, \nmonitoring should be continued throughout this period. Further treatment with infliximab must not be \ngiven if a patient develops a serious infection or sepsis. \nCaution should be exercised when considering the use of infliximab in patients with chronic infection \nor a history of recurrent infections, including concomitant immunosuppressive therapy. Patients \nshould be advised of and avoid exposure to potential risk factors for infection as appropriate. \nTumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune \nresponses. Experimental data show that TNF\u03b1 is essential for the clearing of intracellular infections. \nClinical experience shows that host defence against infection is compromised in some patients treated \nwith infliximab. \nIt should be noted that suppression of TNF\u03b1 may mask symptoms of infection such as fever. Early \nrecognition of atypical clinical presentations of serious infections and of typical clinical presentation \nof rare and unusual infections is critical in order to minimise delays in diagnosis and treatment.  \nPatients taking TNF-blockers are more susceptible to serious infections. \nTuberculosis, bacterial infections, including sepsis and pneumonia, invasive fungal, viral, and other \nopportunistic infections have been observed in patients treated with infliximab. Some of these \ninfections have been fatal; the most frequently reported opportunistic infections with a mortality rate \nof >5% include pneumocystosis, candidiasis, listeriosis and aspergillosis. \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with infliximab, should be \nmonitored closely and undergo a complete diagnostic evaluation. Administration of infliximab should \nbe discontinued if a patient develops a new serious infection or sepsis, and appropriate antimicrobial \nor antifungal therapy should be initiated until the infection is controlled. \nTuberculosis \nThere have been reports of active tuberculosis in patients receiving infliximab. It should be noted that \nin the majority of these reports tuberculosis was extrapulmonary, presenting as either local or \ndisseminated disease. \nBefore starting treatment with infliximab, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, (e.g. tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray, and/or \nInterferon Gamma Release Assay), should be performed in all patients (local recommendations may \napply). It is recommended that the conduct of these tests should be recorded in the patient reminder \ncard. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in \npatients who are severely ill or immunocompromised. \nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, infliximab therapy must not be initiated (see section 4.3).  \nIf latent tuberculosis is suspected, a physician with expertise in the treatment of tuberculosis should be \nconsulted. In all situations described below, the benefit/risk balance of infliximab therapy should be \nvery carefully considered. \nIf inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with \nantituberculosis therapy before the initiation of infliximab, and in accordance with local \nrecommendations. \nIn patients who have several or significant risk factors for tuberculosis and have a negative test for \nlatent tuberculosis, antituberculosis therapy should be considered before the initiation of infliximab.  \nUse of antituberculosis therapy should also be considered before the initiation of infliximab in patients \nwith a past history of latent or active tuberculosis in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be \nconfirmed. \nSome cases of active tuberculosis have been reported in patients treated with infliximab during and \nafter treatment for latent tuberculosis. \nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g. persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after infliximab \ntreatment. \nInvasive fungal infections \nIn patients treated with infliximab, an invasive fungal infection such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, \npneumocystosis, histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis should be suspected if they \ndevelop a serious systemic illness, and a physician with expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of \ninvasive fungal infections should be consulted at an early stage when investigating these patients.  \nInvasive fungal infections may present as disseminated rather than localised disease, and antigen and \nantibody testing may be negative in some patients with active infection. Appropriate empiric \nantifungal therapy should be considered while a diagnostic workup is being performed taking into \naccount both the risk for severe fungal infection and the risks of antifungal therapy. \nFor patients who have resided in or travelled to regions where invasive fungal infections such as \nhistoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis are endemic, the benefits and risks of infliximab \ntreatment should be carefully considered before initiation of infliximab therapy. \nFistulising Crohn\u2019s disease \nPatients with fistulising Crohn\u2019s disease with acute suppurative fistulas must not initiate infliximab \ntherapy until a source for possible infection, specifically abscess, has been excluded (see section 4.3). \nHepatitis B (HBV) reactivation \nReactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including infliximab, \nwho are chronic carriers of this virus. Some cases have had fatal outcome. \nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with infliximab. For patients \nwho test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with infliximab should be closely \nmonitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection throughout therapy and for several months \nfollowing termination of therapy. Adequate data of treating patients who are carriers of HBV with \nantiviral therapy in conjunction with TNF-antagonist therapy to prevent HBV reactivation are not \navailable. In patients who develop HBV reactivation, infliximab should be stopped and effective \nantiviral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated. \n10 \nHepatobiliary events \nCases of jaundice and non-infectious hepatitis, some with features of autoimmune hepatitis, have been \nobserved in the post-marketing experience of infliximab. Isolated cases of liver failure resulting in \nliver transplantation or death have occurred. Patients with symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction \nshould be evaluated for evidence of liver injury. If jaundice and/or ALT elevations \n\u22655 times the upper \nlimit of normal develop(s), infliximab should be discontinued, and a thorough investigation of the \nabnormality should be undertaken. \nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and anakinra \nSerious infections and neutropenia were seen in clinical studies with concurrent use of anakinra and \nanother TNF\u03b1-blocking agent, etanercept, with no added clinical benefit compared to etanercept alone. \nBecause of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with combination of etanercept and anakinra \ntherapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra and other TNF\u03b1-blocking \nagents. Therefore, the combination of infliximab and anakinra is not recommended. \nConcurrent administration of TNF-alpha inhibitor and abatacept \nIn clinical studies concurrent administration of TNF-antagonists and abatacept has been associated \nwith an increased risk of infections including serious infections compared to TNF-antagonists alone, \nwithout increased clinical benefit. The combination of infliximab and abatacept is not recommended. \nConcurrent administration with other biological therapeutics \nThere is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of infliximab with other biological \ntherapeutics used to treat the same conditions as infliximab. The concomitant use of infliximab with \nthese biologics is not recommended because of the possibility of an increased risk of infection, and \nother potential pharmacological interactions. \nSwitching between biological DMARDs \nCare should be taken and patients should continue to be monitored when switching from one biologic \nto another, since overlapping biological activity may further increase the risk for adverse reactions, \nincluding infection. \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in agreement \nwith current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating Remsima therapy. Patients on infliximab may \nreceive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \nIn a subset of 90 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis from the ASPIRE study a similar proportion \nof patients in each treatment group (methotrexate plus: placebo [n = 17], 3 mg/kg [n = 27] or 6 mg/kg \ninfliximab [n = 46]) mounted an effective two-fold increase in titers to a polyvalent pneumococcal \nvaccine, indicating that infliximab did not interfere with T-cell independent humoral immune \nresponses. However, studies from the published literature in various indications (e.g. rheumatoid \narthritis, psoriasis, Crohn\u2019s disease) suggest that non-live vaccinations received during treatment with \nanti-TNF therapies, including infliximab may elicit a lower immune response than in patients not \nreceiving anti-TNF therapy. \nLive vaccines/therapeutic infectious agents \nIn patients receiving anti-TNF therapy, limited data are available on the response to vaccination with \nlive vaccines or on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines. Use of live vaccines can \nresult in clinical infections, including disseminated infections. The concurrent administration of live \nvaccines with infliximab is not recommended. \n11 \nInfant exposure \nin utero\nIn infants exposed \nin utero\n to infliximab, fatal outcome due to disseminated Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin \n(BCG) infection has been reported following administration of BCG vaccine after birth. A twelve \nmonth waiting period following birth is recommended before the administration of live vaccines to \ninfants exposed \nin utero \nto infliximab. If infant infliximab serum levels are undetectable or infliximab \nadministration was limited to the first trimester of pregnancy, administration of a live vaccine might be \nconsidered at an earlier timepoint if there is a clear clinical benefit for the individual infant (see \nsection 4.6). \nInfant exposure via breast milk \nAdministration of a live vaccine to a breastfed infant while the mother is receiving infliximab is not \nrecommended unless infant infliximab serum levels are undetectable (see section 4.6). \nTherapeutic infectious agents \nOther uses of therapeutic infectious agents such as live attenuated bacteria (e.g., BCG bladder \ninstillation for the treatment of cancer) could result in clinical infections, including disseminated \ninfections. It is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with \ninfliximab. \nAutoimmune processes \nThe relative deficiency of TNF\u03b1 caused by anti-TNF therapy may result in the initiation of an \nautoimmune process. If a patient develops symptoms suggestive of a lupus-like syndrome following \ntreatment with infliximab and is positive for antibodies against double-stranded DNA, further \ntreatment with infliximab must not be given (see section 4.8). \nNeurological events \nUse of TNF-blocking agents, including infliximab, has been associated with cases of new onset or \nexacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of central nervous system \ndemyelinating disorders, including multiple sclerosis, and peripheral demyelinating disorders, \nincluding Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating \ndisorders, the benefits and risks of anti-TNF treatment should be carefully considered before initiation \nof infliximab therapy. Discontinuation of infliximab should be considered if these disorders develop. \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nIn the controlled portions of clinical studies of TNF-blocking agents, more cases of malignancies \nincluding lymphoma have been observed among patients receiving a TNF blocker compared with \ncontrol patients. During clinical studies of infliximab across all approved indications the incidence of \nlymphoma in infliximab-treated patients was higher than expected in the general population, but the \noccurrence of lymphoma was rare. In the post-marketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been \nreported in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist. There is an increased background risk for \nlymphoma and leukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, \ninflammatory disease, which complicates risk estimation. \nIn an exploratory clinical study evaluating the use of infliximab in patients with moderate to severe \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), more malignancies were reported in infliximab-\ntreated patients compared with control patients. All patients had a history of heavy smoking. Caution \nshould be exercised in considering treatment of patients with increased risk for malignancy due to \nheavy smoking. \nWith the current knowledge, a risk for the development of lymphomas or other malignancies in \npatients treated with a TNF-blocking agent cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). Caution should be \n12 \nexercised when considering TNF-blocking therapy for patients with a history of malignancy or when \nconsidering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy. \nCaution should also be exercised in patients with psoriasis and a medical history of extensive \nimmunosuppressant therapy or prolonged PUVA treatment. \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-\nblocking agents (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), including \ninfliximab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in patients treated with \nTNF-blockers cannot be excluded. \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) have been reported in patients \ntreated with TNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very \naggressive disease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or \n6-MP concomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of infliximab \ncases have occurred in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in \nadolescent or young adult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and \ninfliximab should be carefully considered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell \nlymphoma in patients treated with infliximab cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \nMelanoma and Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported in patients treated with TNF blocker \ntherapy, including infliximab (see section 4.8). Periodic skin examination is recommended, \nparticularly for patients with risk factors for skin cancer. \nA population-based retrospective cohort study using data from Swedish national health registries \nfound an increased incidence of cervical cancer in women with rheumatoid arthritis treated with \ninfliximab compared to biologics-na\u00efve patients or the general population, including those over \n60 years of age. Periodic screening should continue in women treated with infliximab, including those \nover 60 years of age. \nAll patients with ulcerative colitis who are at increased risk for dysplasia or colon carcinoma (for \nexample, patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis), or who had a \nprior history of dysplasia or colon carcinoma should be screened for dysplasia at regular intervals \nbefore therapy and throughout their disease course. This evaluation should include colonoscopy and \nbiopsies per local recommendations. Current data do not indicate that infliximab treatment influences \nthe risk for developing dysplasia or colon cancer. \nSince the possibility of increased risk of cancer development in patients with newly diagnosed \ndysplasia treated with infliximab is not established, the risk and benefits of continued therapy to the \nindividual patients should be carefully considered by the clinician. \nHeart failure \nInfliximab should be used with caution in patients with mild heart failure (NYHA class I/II). Patients \nshould be closely monitored and infliximab must not be continued in patients who develop new or \nworsening symptoms of heart failure (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). \nHaematologic reactions \nThere have been reports of pancytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia in patients \nreceiving TNF-blockers, including infliximab. All patients should be advised to seek immediate \nmedical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias (e.g. persistent \nfever, bruising, bleeding, pallor). Discontinuation of infliximab therapy should be considered in \npatients with confirmed significant haematologic abnormalities. \n13 \nOthers \nThere is limited safety experience of infliximab treatment in patients who have undergone surgical \nprocedures, including arthroplasty. The long half-life of infliximab should be taken into consideration \nif a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on infliximab should be \nclosely monitored for infections, and appropriate actions should be taken. \nFailure to respond to treatment for Crohn\u2019s disease may indicate the presence of a fixed fibrotic \nstricture that may require surgical treatment. There is no evidence to suggest that infliximab worsens \nor causes fibrotic strictures. \nSpecial populations  \nElderly \nThe incidence of serious infections in infliximab-treated patients 65 years and older was greater than \nin those under 65 years of age. Some of those had a fatal outcome. Particular attention regarding the \nrisk for infection should be paid when treating the elderly (see section 4.8). \nPaediatric population \nInfections \nIn clinical studies, infections have been reported in a higher proportion of paediatric patients compared \nto adult patients (see section 4.8). \nVaccinations \nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all vaccinations in \nagreement with current vaccination guidelines prior to initiating infliximab therapy. Paediatric patients \non infliximab may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines (see sections 4.5 and 4.6). \nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders \nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-\nblocking agents (initiation of therapy \u226418 years of age), including \ninfliximab in the post-marketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other \ncases represented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies usually associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-blockers cannot be excluded. \nPost-marketing cases of hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-blocking agents including infliximab. This rare type of T-cell lymphoma has a very aggressive \ndisease course and is usually fatal. Almost all patients had received treatment with AZA or 6-MP \nconcomitantly with or immediately prior to a TNF-blocker. The vast majority of infliximab cases have \noccurred in patients with Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis and most were reported in adolescent or \nyoung adult males. The potential risk with the combination of AZA or 6-MP and infliximab should be \ncarefully considered. A risk for the development for hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma in patients treated \nwith infliximab cannot be excluded (see section 4.8). \nSodium content \nRemsima contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019. Remsima \nis however, diluted in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for infusion. This should be taken into \nconsideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet (see section 6.6).", "pregnancy": "No interaction studies have been performed. \n14 \nIn rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease patients, there are indications that \nconcomitant use of methotrexate and other immunomodulators reduces the formation of antibodies \nagainst infliximab and increases the plasma concentrations of infliximab. However, the results are \nuncertain due to limitations in the methods used for serum analyses of infliximab and antibodies \nagainst infliximab. \nCorticosteroids do not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of infliximab to a clinically relevant \nextent. \nThe combination of infliximab with other biological therapeutics used to treat the same conditions as \ninfliximab, including anakinra and abatacept, is not recommended (see section 4.4). \nIt is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with infliximab. It is also \nrecommended that live vaccines not be given to infants after \nin utero\n exposure to infliximab for \n12 months following birth. If infant infliximab serum levels are undetectable or infliximab \nadministration was limited to the first trimester of pregnancy, administration of a live vaccine might be \nconsidered at an earlier timepoint if there is a clear clinical benefit for the individual infant (see \nsection 4.4). \nAdministration of a live vaccine to a breastfed infant while the mother is receiving infliximab is not \nrecommended unless infant infliximab serum levels are undetectable (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \nIt is recommended that therapeutic infectious agents not be given concurrently with infliximab (see \nsection 4.4).", "driving": "Women of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of adequate contraception to prevent \npregnancy and continue its use for at least 6 months after the last infliximab treatment. \nPregnancy \nThe moderate number of prospectively collected pregnancies exposed to infliximab resulting in live \nbirth with known outcomes, including approximately 1,100 exposed during the first trimester, does not \nindicate an increase in the rate of malformation in the newborn.  \nBased on an observational study from Northern Europe, an increased risk (OR, 95% CI; p-value) for \nC-section (1.50, 1.14-1.96; p = 0.0032), preterm birth (1.48, 1.05-2.09; p = 0.024), small for \ngestational age (2.79, 1.54-5.04; p = 0.0007), and low birth weight (2.03, 1.41-2.94; p = 0.0002) was \nobserved in women exposed during pregnancy to infliximab (with or without \nimmunomodulators/corticosteroids, 270 pregnancies) as compared to women exposed to \nimmunomodulators and/or corticosteroids only (6,460 pregnancies). The potential contribution of \nexposure to infliximab and/or the severity of the underlying disease in these outcomes remains \nunclear. \nDue to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, infliximab administered during pregnancy could affect normal immune \nresponses in the newborn. In a developmental toxicity study conducted in mice using an analogous \nantibody that selectively inhibits the functional activity of mouse TNF\u03b1, there was no indication of \nmaternal toxicity, embryotoxicity or teratogenicity (see section 5.3). \nThe available clinical experience is limited. Infliximab should only be used during pregnancy if \nclearly needed. \nInfliximab crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants up to 12 months \nfollowing birth. After \nin utero\n exposure to infliximab, infants may be at increased risk of infection, \n15 \nincluding serious disseminated infection that can become fatal. Administration of live vaccines \n(e.g., BCG vaccine) to infants exposed to infliximab \nin utero\n is not recommended for 12 months after \nbirth (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). If infant infliximab serum levels are undetectable or infliximab \nadministration was limited to the first trimester of pregnancy, administration of a live vaccine might be \nconsidered at an earlier timepoint if there is a clear clinical benefit for the individual infant. Cases of \nagranulocytosis have also been reported (see section 4.8). \nBreast-feeding \nLimited data from published literature indicate infliximab has been detected at low levels in human \nmilk at concentrations up to 5% of the maternal serum level. Infliximab has also been detected in \ninfant serum after exposure to infliximab via breast milk. While systemic exposure in a breastfed \ninfant is expected to be low because infliximab is largely degraded in the gastrointestinal tract, the \nadministration of live vaccines to a breastfed infant when the mother is receiving infliximab is not \nrecommended unless infant infliximab serum levels are undetectable. Infliximab could be considered \nfor use during breast-feeding. \nFertility \nThere are insufficient preclinical data to draw conclusions on the effects of infliximab on fertility and \ngeneral reproductive function (see section 5.3).", "side_effects": "Remsima may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

As with all insulin preparations, the duration of action of \nHumalog is dependent on dose, site of injection, blood supply, temperature, and physical activity. \nHumalog can be used in conjunction with a longer-acting insulin or oral sulphonylurea agents, on the \nadvice of a physician.  \nSpecial populations \nRenal impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in the presence of renal impairment. \nHepatic impairment \nInsulin requirements may be reduced in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin breakdown; however, in patients with chronic hepatic \nimpairment, an increase in insulin resistance may lead to increased insulin requirements. \nPaediatric population \nHumalog can be used in adolescents and children (see section 5.1). \nMethod of administration \nSubcutaneous use \nHumalog preparations should be given by subcutaneous injection.  \nThe KwikPen,Junior KwikPen and Tempo Pen are only suitable for subcutaneous injections. Humalog \nin cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a Lilly reusable pen or compatible pump \nsystems for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).  \nSubcutaneous administration should be in the upper arms, thighs, buttocks, or abdomen. Use of \ninjection sites should be rotated so that the same site is not used more than approximately once a \nmonth, in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see section 4.4 and \n4.8). \nWhen administered subcutaneously care should be taken when injecting Humalog to ensure that a \nblood vessel has not been entered. After injection, the site of injection should not be massaged. \nPatients must be educated to use the proper injection techniques. \nHumalog KwikPens \nHumalog KwikPen is available in two strengths. The Humalog 100 units/ml KwikPen (and Humalog \n200 units/ml KwikPen, \nsee separate SmPC)\n delivers 1 \u2013 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. \nThe Humalog 100 units/ml Junior KwikPen delivers 0.5 \u2013 30 units in steps of 0.5 units in a single \ninjection.\n The number of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of \nstrength and no \ndose conversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a \npen with a different dose step.  \nHumalog\nTempo Pen\nThe Humalog 100 units/ml Tempo Pen delivers 1 \u2013 60 units in steps of 1 unit in a single injection. The \nnumber of insulin units is shown in the dose window of the pen regardless of strength and no dose \nconversion should be done when transferring a patient to a new strength or to a pen with a different \ndose step. The Tempo Pen can be used with the optional transfer module Tempo Smart Button (see \nsection 6.6). \nAs with any insulin injection, when using the Tempo Pen, Smart Button and the mobile application, \nthe patient should be instructed to check their blood sugar levels when considering or making \ndecisions about another injection if they are unsure how much they have injected. \nUse of Humalog in an insulin infusion pump \nFor subcutaneous injection of Humalog using a continuous infusion pump, you may fill the pump \nreservoir from a Humalog 100 units/ml vial. Some pumps are compatible with cartridges that can be \ninserted intact into the pump. \nOnly certain CE-marked insulin infusion pumps may be used to infuse insulin lispro. Before infusing \ninsulin lispro, the pump manufacturer\u2019s instructions should be studied to ascertain the suitability for \nthe particular pump. Use the correct reservoir and catheter for the pump. When filling the pump \nreservoir avoid damaging it by using the correct needle length on the filling system. The infusion set \n(tubing and cannula) should be changed in accordance with the instructions in the product information \nsupplied with the infusion set. In the event of a hypoglycaemic episode, the infusion should be stopped \nuntil the episode is resolved. If repeated or severe low blood glucose levels occur consider the need to \nreduce or stop an insulin infusion. A pump malfunction or obstruction of the infusion set can result in \na rapid rise in glucose levels. If an interruption to insulin flow is suspected, follow the instructions in \nthe pump product literature. When used with an insulin infusion pump, Humalog should not be mixed \nwith any other insulin.\nIntravenous administration of insulin \nIf necessary, Humalog may also be administered intravenously, for example: for the control of blood \nglucose levels during ketoacidosis, acute illnesses or during intra and post operative periods. \nHumalog 100 units /ml is available in vials if administration of intravenous injection is necessary.   \nIntravenous injection of insulin lispro should be carried out following normal clinical practise for \nintravenous injections, for example by an intravenous bolus or by an infusion system. Frequent \nmonitoring of the blood glucose levels is required. \nInfusion systems at concentrations from 0.1 units/ml to 1.0 units/ml insulin lispro in 0.9% sodium \nchloride or 5% dextrose are stable at room temperature for 48 hours. It is recommended that the \nsystem is primed before starting the infusion to the patient.", "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nHypoglycaemia.", "special_warnings": "Traceability \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered medicinal product should be clearly recorded. \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin  \nTransferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical \nsupervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular/soluble, NPH/isophane,  etc.), \nspecies (animal, human, human insulin analogue), and/or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA \nversus animal-source insulin) may result in the need for a change in dosage. For fast-acting insulins, \nany patient also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to obtain glucose control across \nthe whole day, particularly nocturnal/fasting glucose control. \nVial \nWhen mixing Humalog with a longer acting insulin, the shorter-acting Humalog should be drawn into \nthe syringe first, to prevent contamination of the vial by the longer-acting insulin. Mixing of the \ninsulins ahead of time or just before the injection should be on advice of the physician. However, a \nconsistent routine must be followed. \nHypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia \nConditions which may make the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia different or less \npronounced include long duration of diabetes, intensified insulin therapy, diabetic nerve disease or \nmedications such as beta-blockers. \nA few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal-source \ninsulin to human insulin have reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less \npronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin. Uncorrected \nhypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic reactions can cause loss of consciousness, coma, or death. \nThe use of dosages which are inadequate or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-\ndependent diabetics, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are \npotentially lethal. \nInjection technique \nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin \nabsorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A \nsudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. \nBlood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment \nof antidiabetic medications may be considered. \nInsulin requirements and dosage adjustment \nInsulin requirements may be increased during illness or emotional disturbances. \nAdjustment of dosage may also be necessary if patients undertake increased physical activity or \nchange their usual diet. Exercise taken immediately after a meal may increase the risk of \nhypoglycaemia. A consequence of the pharmacodynamics of rapid-acting insulin analogues is that if \nhypoglycaemia occurs, it may occur earlier after an injection when compared with soluble human \ninsulin. \nCombination of Humalog with pioglitazone \nCases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, \nespecially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in \nmind, if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Humalog is considered. If the \ncombination is used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain \nand oedema. Pioglitazone should be discontinued, if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs. \nAvoidance of medication errors \nPatients must be instructed to always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Humalog KwikPen as well as other insulin products. \nPatients must visually verify the dialled units on the dose counter of the pen. Therefore, the \nrequirement for patients to self-inject is that they can read the dose counter on the pen. Patients who \nare blind or have poor vision must be instructed to always get help/assistance from another person who \nhas good vision and is trained in using the insulin device. \nTempo Pen  \nThe Tempo Pen contains a magnet (see section 6.5) that may interfere with the functions of an \nimplantable electronic medical device, such as a pacemaker.

However, initiation of therapy with 75 mg could be considered, particularly in haemodialyzed \npatients and in the elderly over 75 years. \nIn patients insufficiently controlled with 150 mg once daily, the dose of Karvea can be increased to \n300 mg, or other antihypertensive agents can be added (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). In \nparticular, the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide has been shown to have an additive \neffect with Karvea (see section 4.5). \nIn hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients, therapy should be initiated at 150 mg irbesartan once daily \nand titrated up to 300 mg once daily as the preferred maintenance dose for treatment of renal disease. \nThe demonstration of renal benefit of Karvea in hypertensive type 2 diabetic patients is based on \nstudies where irbesartan was used in addition to other antihypertensive agents, as needed, to reach \ntarget blood pressure (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1). \nSpecial Populations \nRenal impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. A lower starting dose \n(75 mg) should be considered for patients undergoing haemodialysis (see section 4.4). \nHepatic impairment\nNo dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. There is no \nclinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. \nOlder people\nAlthough consideration should be given to initiating therapy with 75 mg in patients over 75 years of \nage, dosage adjustment is not usually necessary for the older people. \nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Karvea in children aged 0 to 18 has not been established. Currently \navailable data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be \nmade. \nMethod of Administration \nFor oral use.", "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nSecond and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). \n The concomitant use of Karvea with aliskiren-containing products is contraindicated in patients with \ndiabetes mellitus or renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73m2) (see \nsections 4.5 and 5.1).", "special_warnings": "Intravascular volume depletion: symptomatic hypotension, especially after the first dose, may occur in \npatients who are volume and/or sodium depleted by vigorous diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction, \ndiarrhoea or vomiting. Such conditions should be corrected before the administration of Karvea. \nRenovascular hypertension: there is an increased risk of severe hypotension and renal insufficiency \nwhen patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney \nare treated with medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. While this is \nnot documented with Karvea, a similar effect should be anticipated with angiotensin-II receptor \nantagonists. \nRenal impairment and kidney transplantation: when Karvea is used in patients with impaired renal \nfunction, a periodic monitoring of potassium and creatinine serum levels is recommended. There is no \nexperience regarding the administration of Karvea in patients with a recent kidney transplantation. \nHypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and renal disease: the effects of irbesartan both on renal and \ncardiovascular events were not uniform across all subgroups, in an analysis carried out in the study \nwith patients with advanced renal disease. In particular, they appeared less favourable in women and \nnon-white subjects (see section 5.1). \nDual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): \nThere is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or \naliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including \nacute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin \nII receptor blockers or aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  If dual \nblockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist \nsupervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. \nACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with \ndiabetic nephropathy. \nHyperkalaemia: as with other medicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, \nhyperkalaemia may occur during the treatment with Karvea, especially in the presence of renal \nimpairment, overt proteinuria due to diabetic renal disease, and/or heart failure. Close monitoring of \nserum potassium in patients at risk is recommended (see section 4.5). \nHypoglycaemia: Karvea may induce hypoglycaemia, particularly in diabetic patients. In patients \ntreated with insulin or antidiabetics an appropriate blood glucose monitoring should be considered; a \ndose adjustment of insulin or antidiabetics may be required when indicated (see section 4.5). \nLithium: the combination of lithium and Karvea is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nAortic and mitral valve stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: as with other vasodilators, \nspecial caution is indicated in patients suffering from aortic or mitral stenosis, or obstructive \nhypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \nPrimary aldosteronism: patients with primary aldosteronism generally will not respond to \nantihypertensive medicinal products acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system. \nTherefore, the use of Karvea is not recommended. \nGeneral: in patients whose vascular tone and renal function depend predominantly on the activity of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients with severe congestive heart failure or \nunderlying renal disease, including renal artery stenosis), treatment with angiotensin\nconverting \nenzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists that affect this system has been associated \nwith acute hypotension, azotaemia, oliguria, or rarely acute renal failure (see section 4.5). As with any \nantihypertensive agent, excessive blood pressure decrease in patients with ischaemic cardiopathy or \nischaemic cardiovascular disease could result in a myocardial infarction or stroke. \nAs observed for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, irbesartan and the other angiotensin \nantagonists are apparently less effective in lowering blood pressure in black people than in non-blacks, \npossibly because of higher prevalence of low-renin states in the black hypertensive population (see \nsection 5.1). \nPregnancy: angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. \nUnless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be \nchanged to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in \npregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, \nand, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6). \nPaediatric population: irbesartan has been studied in paediatric populations aged 6 to 16 years old but \nthe current data are insufficient to support an extension of the use in children until further data become \navailable (see sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). \nExcipients: \nKarvea 75 mg tablet contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, \ntotal lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. \nKarvea 75 mg tablet contains sodium. This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per \ntablet, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.", "pregnancy": "Diuretics and other antihypertensive agents: other antihypertensive agents may increase the \nhypotensive effects of irbesartan; however Karvea has been safely administered with other \nantihypertensive agents, such as beta-blockers, long-acting calcium channel blockers, and thiazide \ndiuretics. Prior treatment with high dose diuretics may result in volume depletion and a risk of \nhypotension when initiating therapy with Karvea (see section 4.4). \nAliskiren-containing products or ACE-inhibitors: clinical trial data has shown that dual blockade of \nthe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) through the combined use of ACE-inhibitors, \nangiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events \nsuch as hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) \ncompared to the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). \nPotassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics:\nbased on experience with the use of other \nmedicinal products that affect the renin-angiotensin system, concomitant use of potassium-sparing \ndiuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other medicinal products \nthat may increase serum potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and \nis, therefore, not recommended (see section 4.4). \nLithium:\nreversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during \nconcomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Similar effects \nhave been very rarely reported with irbesartan so far. Therefore, this combination is not recommended \n(see section 4.4). If the combination proves necessary, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is \nrecommended.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: when angiotensin II antagonists are administered \nsimultaneously with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e. selective COX-2 inhibitors, \nacetylsalicylic acid (> 3 g/day) and non-selective NSAIDs), attenuation of the antihypertensive effect \nmay occur. \nAs with ACE inhibitors, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and NSAIDs may lead to an \nincreased risk of worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, and an increase in \nserum potassium, especially in patients with poor pre-existing renal function. The combination should \nbe administered with caution, especially in the elderly. Patients should be adequately hydrated and \nconsideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and \nperiodically thereafter. \nRepaglinide: irbesartan has the potential to inhibit OATP1B1. In a clinical study, it was reported that \nirbesartan increased the Cmax and AUC of repaglinide (substrate of OATP1B1) by 1.8-fold and \n1.3-fold, respectively, when administered 1 hour before repaglinide. In another study, no relevant \npharmacokinetic interaction was reported, when the two drugs were co-administered. Therefore, dose \nadjustment of antidiabetic treatment such as repaglinide may be required (see section 4.4). \nAdditional information on irbesartan interactions: in clinical studies, the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nis not affected by hydrochlorothiazide. Irbesartan is mainly metabolised by CYP2C9 and to a lesser \nextent by glucuronidation. No significant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions were \nobserved when irbesartan was coadministered with warfarin, a medicinal product metabolised by \nCYP2C9. The effects of CYP2C9 inducers such as rifampicin on the pharmacokinetic of irbesartan \nhave not been evaluated. The pharmacokinetic of digoxin was not altered by coadministration of \nirbesartan.", "driving": "Pregnancy \nThe use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The \nuse of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 \nand 4.4). \nEpidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors \nduring the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk \ncannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with Angiotensin II \nReceptor Antagonists (AIIRAs), similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued \nAIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative \nantihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When \npregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, \nalternative therapy should be started. \nExposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human \nfetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal \ntoxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia). (See section 5.3). \nShould exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check \nof renal function and skull is recommended. \nInfants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see \nsections 4.3 and 4.4). \nBreast-feeding \nBecause no information is available regarding the use of Karvea during breast-feeding, Karvea is not \nrecommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding \nare preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. \nIt is unknown whether irbesartan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  \nAvailable pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in rats have shown excretion of irbesartan or its \nmetabolites in milk (for details see 5.3). \nFertility \nIrbesartan had no effect upon fertility of treated rats and their offspring up to the dose levels inducing \nthe first signs of parental toxicity (see section 5.3).", "side_effects": "Based on its pharmacodynamic properties, irbesartan is unlikely to affect the ability to drive and use \nmachine.

In these cases the physician should refer to the individual product information for dolutegravir. \nMissed doses \nIf the patient misses a dose of Dovato, the patient should take Dovato as soon as possible, providing the next \ndose is not due within 4 hours. If the next dose is due within 4 hours, the patient should not take the missed \ndose and simply resume the usual dosing schedule. \nElderly \nThere are limited data available on the use of Dovato in patients aged 65 years and over. No dose adjustment \nis necessary (see section 5.2). \nRenal impairment \nDovato is not recommended for use in patients with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min (see section 5.2). No \ndose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. However, the lamivudine \nexposure is significantly increased in patients with a creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min (see section 4.4). \nHepatic impairment \nNo dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade A \nor B). No data are available in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh grade C); therefore \nDovato should be used with caution in these patients (see section 5.2). \nPaediatric population\nThe safety and efficacy of Dovato in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 40 kg have not \nbeen established. No data are available. \nMethod of administration \nOral use.  \nDovato can be taken with or without food (see section 5.2).", "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. \nCo-administration with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows, that are substrates of organic \ncation transporter (OCT) 2, including but not limited to fampridine (also known as dalfampridine; see section \n4.5).", "special_warnings": "Hypersensitivity reactions \nHypersensitivity reactions have been reported with dolutegravir, and were characterized by rash, \nconstitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including severe liver reactions. Dovato and other \nsuspect medicinal products should be discontinued immediately if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity \nreactions develop (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by raised liver enzymes, \nfever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial oedema, \neosinophilia, angioedema). Clinical status including liver aminotransferases and bilirubin should be \nmonitored. Delay in stopping treatment with Dovato or other suspect active substances after the onset of \nhypersensitivity may result in a life-threatening allergic reaction.\nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral therapy. Such \nchanges may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle. For lipids and weight, there is in some cases \nevidence for a treatment effect. For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose reference is made to established \nHIV treatment guidelines. Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate.\nLiver disease \nPatients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased \nrisk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse reactions. In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for \nhepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products. \nDovato includes lamivudine, which is active against hepatitis B. Dolutegravir lacks such activity. \nLamivudine monotherapy is generally not considered an adequate treatment for hepatitis B, since the risk for \nhepatitis B resistance development is high. If Dovato is used in patients co-infected with hepatitis B an \nadditional antiviral is therefore generally needed. Reference should be made to treatment guidelines. \nIf Dovato is discontinued in patients co-infected with hepatitis B virus, periodic monitoring of both liver \nfunction tests and markers of HBV replication is recommended, as withdrawal of lamivudine may result in \nan acute exacerbation of hepatitis.\nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis have an increased frequency of \nliver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy, and should be monitored according to \nstandard practice. If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in such patients, interruption or \ndiscontinuation of treatment must be considered.\nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination \nantiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic \npathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms. Typically, such \nreactions have been observed within the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART. Relevant examples \nare \nCytomegalovirus retinitis\n, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and \nPneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia (often referred to as PCP). Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment \ninstituted when necessary. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have \nalso been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more \nvariable and these events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \nLiver chemistry elevations consistent with immune reconstitution syndrome were observed in some hepatitis \nB and/or C co-infected patients at the start of dolutegravir therapy. Monitoring of liver chemistries is \nrecommended in patients with hepatitis B and/or C co-infection. (See \u2018Liver disease\u2019 earlier in this section \nand also see section 4.8).\nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure \nin utero \nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine. There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV-negative infants exposed \nin utero\n and/or post-natally to nucleoside analogues, these have \npredominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine. The main adverse reactions \nreported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia), and metabolic disorders (hyperlactatemia, \nhyperlipasemia). These reactions have often been transitory. Some late-onset neurological disorders have \nbeen reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour). Whether such neurological disorders are \ntransient or permanent is currently unknown. These findings should be considered for any child exposed \nin \nutero\n to nucleoside and nucleotide analogues, who presents with severe clinical findings of unknown \naetiology, particularly neurologic findings. These findings do not affect current national recommendations to \nuse antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical transmission of HIV. \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, biphosphonates, \nalcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/or long-term exposure to CART. Patients should be \nadvised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint stiffness or difficulty in \nmovement. \nOpportunistic infections \nPatients should be advised that dolutegravir, lamivudine or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV \ninfection. Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians experienced in the \ntreatment of these associated HIV diseases. \nAdministration in subjects with moderate renal impairment \nPatients with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min receiving Dovato may experience a 1.6-to \n3.3-fold higher lamivudine exposure (AUC) than patients with a creatinine clearance \u226550 mL/min. There are \nno safety data from randomized, controlled trials comparing Dovato to the individual components in patients \nwith a creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who received dose-adjusted lamivudine. In the \noriginal lamivudine registrational trials in combination with zidovudine, higher lamivudine exposures were \nassociated with higher rates of haematologic toxicities (neutropenia and anaemia), although discontinuations \ndue to neutropenia or anaemia each occurred in <1% of subjects. Other lamivudine-related adverse events \n(such as gastro-intestinal and hepatic disorders) may occur. \nPatients with a sustained creatinine clearance between 30 and 49 mL/min who receive Dovato should be \nmonitored for lamivudine-related adverse events, notably haematologic toxicities. If new or worsening \nneutropenia or anaemia develop, a dose adjustment of lamivudine, per lamivudine prescribing information, is \nindicated, which cannot be achieved with Dovato. Dovato should be discontinued and the individual \ncomponents should be used to construct the treatment regimen. \nDrug interactions \nThe recommended dose of dolutegravir is 50 mg twice daily when co-administered with rifampicin, \ncarbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St. John\u2019s wort, etravirine (without boosted \nprotease inhibitors), efavirenz, nevirapine, or tipranavir/ritonavir (see section 4.5). \nDovato should not be co-administered with polyvalent cation-containing antacids. Polyvalent cation-\ncontaining antacids are recommended to be taken 2 hours after or 6 hours before Dovato (see section 4.5). \nWhen taken with food, Dovato and supplements or multivitamins containing calcium, iron or magnesium can \nbe taken at the same time. If Dovato is administered under fasting conditions, supplements or multivitamins \ncontaining calcium, iron or magnesium are recommended to be taken 2 hours after or 6 hours before Dovato \n(see section 4.5). \nDolutegravir increased metformin concentrations. A dose adjustment of metformin should be considered \nwhen starting and stopping coadministration of Dovato with metformin, to maintain glycaemic control (see \nsection 4.5). Metformin is eliminated renally and, therefore, it is of importance to monitor renal function \nwhen co-treated with Dovato. This combination may increase the risk for lactic acidosis in patients with \nmoderate renal impairment (stage 3a creatinine clearance 45\u2013 59 mL/min) and a cautious approach is \nrecommended. Reduction of the metformin dose should be highly considered. \nThe combination of Dovato with cladribine is not recommended (see section 4.5). \nDovato should not be taken with any other medicinal product containing dolutegravir, lamivudine or \nemtricitabine, except where a dose adjustment of dolutegravir is indicated due to drug-drug interactions (see \nsection 4.5).", "pregnancy": "No drug interaction studies have been conducted using Dovato. Dovato contains dolutegravir and \nlamivudine, therefore any interactions identified for these individually are relevant to Dovato. No clinically \nsignificant drug interactions are expected between dolutegravir and lamivudine. \nEffect of other medicinal products on the pharmacokinetics of dolutegravir and lamivudine \nDolutegravir is eliminated mainly through metabolism by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase \n(UGT) 1A1. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and \nbreast cancer resistance protein\n(BCRP). Co-administration of Dovato and other medicinal products that \ninhibit UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, CYP3A4, and/or P-gp may, therefore, increase dolutegravir plasma \nconcentration. Medicinal products that induce those enzymes or transporters may decrease dolutegravir \nplasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir. \nThe absorption of dolutegravir is reduced by certain metal cation-containing anti-acid substances and \nsupplements (see Table 1). \nLamivudine is cleared renally. Active renal secretion of lamivudine in the urine is mediated through the \nOCT2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE1 and MATE2-K). Trimethoprim (an inhibitor \nof these transporters) has been shown to increase lamivudine plasma concentrations, however the resulting \nincrease was not clinically significant (see Table 1). Dolutegravir is an OCT2 and MATE1 inhibitor; \nhowever, lamivudine concentrations were similar with or without co-administration of dolutegravir based on \na cross study analysis, indicating that dolutegravir has no relevant effect on lamivudine exposure \nin vivo\nLamivudine is also substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter OCT1. As hepatic elimination plays a minor \nrole in the clearance of lamivudine, drug interactions due to inhibition of OCT1 are unlikely to be of clinical \nsignificance. \nAlthough lamivudine is a substrate of BCRP and P-gp \nin vitro\n, given its high absolute bioavailability, (see \nsection 5.2), inhibitors of these efflux transporters are unlikely to result in a clinically relevant impact on \nlamivudine concentrations. \nEffect of dolutegravir and lamivudine on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products \nIn vivo\n, dolutegravir did not have an effect on midazolam, a CYP3A4 probe. Based on \nin vivo\n and/or \nin vitro\ndata, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are substrates of \nany major enzyme or transporter such as CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and P-gp (for more information see section 5.2). \nIn vitro\n, dolutegravir inhibited the renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1. \nIn vivo\n, a 10-14% decrease of \ncreatinine clearance (secretory fraction is dependent on OCT2 and MATE1 transport) was observed in \npatients. \nIn vivo\n, dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products in which excretion \nis dependent upon OCT2 and/or MATE1 (e.g. fampridine [also known as dalfampridine], metformin) (see \nTable 1 and section 4.3). \nIn vitro\n, dolutegravir inhibited the renal uptake organic anion transporters (OAT)1 and OAT3. Based on the \nlack of effect on the \nin vivo\n pharmacokinetics of the OAT substrate tenofovir, \nin vivo\n inhibition of OAT1 is \nunlikely. Inhibition of OAT3 has not been studied \nin vivo\n. Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations \nof medicinal products in which excretion is dependent upon OAT3. \nIn vitro,\n lamivudine was an inhibitor of OCT1 and OCT2; the clinical consequences are not known. \nEstablished and theoretical interactions with selected antiretrovirals and non-antiretroviral medicinal \nproducts are listed in Table 1. \nInteraction table \nInteractions between dolutegravir, lamivudine and co-administered medical products are listed in Table 1 \n(increase is indicated as \u201c\u2191\u201d, decrease as \u201c\u2193\u201d, no change as \u201c\u2194\u201d, area under the concentration versus time \ncurve as \u201cAUC\u201d, maximum observed concentration as \u201cCmax\u201d, concentration at end of dosing interval as \n\u201cC\u03c4\u201d).

Most neural tube defects occur within the first 4 weeks of embryonic development after \nconception (approximately 6 weeks after the last menstrual period). If a pregnancy is confirmed in the first \ntrimester while on Dovato, the benefits and risks of continuing Dovato versus switching to another \nantiretroviral regimen should be discussed with the patient taking the gestational age and the critical time \nperiod of neural tube defect development into account. \nData analysed from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry do not indicate an increased risk of major birth \ndefects in over 600 women exposed to dolutegravir during pregnancy but are currently insufficient to address \nthe risk of neural tube defects.  \nIn animal reproductive toxicology studies with dolutegravir, no adverse development outcomes, including \nneural tube defects, were identified (see section 5.3).  \nMore than 1000 outcomes from exposure to dolutegravir during second and third trimester pregnancy \nindicate no evidence of increased risk of foetal/neonatal toxicity. Dovato may be used during the second and \nthird trimester of pregnancy when the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. \nDolutegravir crosses the placenta in humans. In pregnant women living with HIV, the median foetal \numbilical cord concentration of dolutegravir was approximately 1.3-fold greater compared with the maternal \nperipheral plasma concentration. \nThere is insufficient information on the effects of dolutegravir on neonates. \nA large amount of data on the use of lamivudine in pregnant women (more than 5200 outcomes from first \ntrimester) indicates no malformative toxicity.  \nAnimal studies showed lamivudine may inhibit cellular DNA replication (see section 5.3). The clinical \nrelevance of these findings is unknown. \nMitochondrial dysfunction\nNucleoside and nucleotide analogues have been demonstrated \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n to cause a variable degree \nof mitochondrial damage.

These events have been \nobserved in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy alone or in combination with paclitaxel or \ndocetaxel, particularly following anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) containing chemotherapy. \nThese may be moderate to severe and have been associated with death (see section 4.8). In addition, \ncaution should be exercised in treating patients with increased cardiac risk, e.g. hypertension, \ndocumented coronary artery disease, CHF, LVEF of < 55%, older age. \nAll candidates for treatment with trastuzumab, but especially those with prior anthracycline and \ncyclophosphamide (AC) exposure, should undergo baseline cardiac assessment including history and \nphysical examination, electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and/or multigated acquisition \n(MUGA) scan or magnetic resonance imaging. Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop \ncardiac dysfunction. Cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 months \nduring treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months from the \nlast administration of trastuzumab. A careful risk-benefit assessment should be made before deciding \nto treat with trastuzumab. \nTrastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months after stopping Ogivri treatment based on \npopulation pharmacokinetic analysis of all available data (see section 5.2). Patients who receive \nanthracyclines after stopping trastuzumab may possibly be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. If \npossible, physicians should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping \ntrastuzumab. If anthracyclines are used, the patient\u2019s cardiac function should be monitored carefully. \nFormal cardiological assessment should be considered in patients in whom there are cardiovascular \nconcerns following baseline screening. In all patients cardiac function should be monitored during \ntreatment (e.g. every 12 weeks). Monitoring may help to identify patients who develop cardiac \ndysfunction. Patients who develop asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction may benefit from more frequent \nmonitoring (e.g. every 6 - 8 weeks). If patients have a continued decrease in left ventricular function, \nbut remain asymptomatic, the physician should consider discontinuing therapy if no clinical benefit of \ntrastuzumab therapy has been seen. \nThe safety of continuation or resumption of trastuzumab in patients who experience cardiac \ndysfunction has not been prospectively studied. If LVEF percentage drops \u2265 10 points from baseline \nAND to below 50%, treatment should be suspended and a repeat LVEF assessment performed within \napproximately 3 weeks. If LVEF has not improved, or declined further, or symptomatic CHF has \ndeveloped, discontinuation of trastuzumab should be strongly considered, unless the benefits for the \nindividual patient are deemed to outweigh the risks. All such patients should be referred for \nassessment by a cardiologist and followed up. \nIf symptomatic cardiac failure develops during trastuzumab therapy, it should be treated with standard \nmedicinal products for CHF. Most patients who developed CHF or asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction \nin pivotal trials improved with standard CHF treatment consisting of an angiotensin-converting \nenzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and a beta-blocker. The majority of \npatients with cardiac symptoms and evidence of a clinical benefit of trastuzumab treatment continued \non therapy without additional clinical cardiac events. \nMetastatic breast cancer \nTrastuzumab and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the MBC setting. \nPatients with MBC who have previously received anthracyclines are also at risk of cardiac dysfunction \nwith trastuzumab treatment, although the risk is lower than with concurrent use of trastuzumab and \nanthracyclines. \nEarly breast cancer \nFor patients with EBC, cardiac assessments, as performed at baseline, should be repeated every 3 \nmonths during treatment and every 6 months following discontinuation of treatment until 24 months \nfrom the last administration of trastuzumab. In patients who receive anthracycline-containing \nchemotherapy further monitoring is recommended, and should occur yearly up to 5 years from the last \nadministration of trastuzumab, or longer if a continuous decrease of LVEF is observed. \nPatients with history of myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris requiring medical treatment, \nhistory of or existing CHF (NYHA Class II \u2013IV), LVEF of < 55%, other cardiomyopathy, cardiac \narrhythmia requiring medical treatment, clinically significant cardiac valvular disease, poorly \ncontrolled hypertension (hypertension controlled by standard medical treatment eligible), and \nhemodynamic effective pericardial effusion were excluded from adjuvant and neoadjuvant EBC \npivotal trials with trastuzumab and therefore treatment cannot be recommended in such patients. \nAdjuvant treatment \nTrastuzumab and anthracyclines should not be given concurrently in combination in the adjuvant \ntreatment setting. \nIn patients with EBC an increase in the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events \nwas observed when trastuzumab was administered after anthracycline-containing chemotherapy \ncompared to administration with a non-anthracycline regimen of docetaxel and carboplatin and was \nmore marked when trastuzumab was administered concurrently with taxanes than when administered \nsequentially to taxanes. Regardless of the regimen used, most symptomatic cardiac events occurred \nwithin the first 18 months. In one of the 3 pivotal studies conducted in which a median follow-up of \n5.5 years was available (BCIRG006) a continuous increase in the cumulative rate of symptomatic \ncardiac or LVEF events was observed in patients who were administered trastuzumab concurrently \nwith a taxane following anthracycline therapy up to 2.37 % compared to approximately 1 % in the two \ncomparator arms (anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide followed by taxane and taxane, carboplatin \nand trastuzumab). \nRisk factors for a cardiac event identified in four large adjuvant studies included advanced age \n(> 50 years), low LVEF (< 55 %) at baseline, prior to or following the initiation of paclitaxel \ntreatment, decline in LVEF by 10-15 points, and prior or concurrent use of anti-hypertensive \nmedicinal products. \nIn patients receiving trastuzumab after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the risk of cardiac \ndysfunction was associated with a higher cumulative dose of anthracycline given prior to initiation of \ntrastuzumab and a body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2. \nNeoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment \nIn patients with EBC eligible for neoadjuvant-adjuvant treatment, trastuzumab should be used \nconcurrently with anthracyclines only in chemotherapy-naive patients and only with low-dose \nanthracycline regimens i.e. maximum cumulative doses of doxorubicin 180 mg/m2 or epirubicin \n360 mg/m2. \nIf patients have been treated concurrently with a full course of low-dose anthracyclines and \ntrastuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting, no additional cytotoxic chemotherapy should be given after \nsurgery. In other situations, the decision on the need for additional cytotoxic chemotherapy is \ndetermined based on individual factors. \nExperience of concurrent administration of trastuzumab with low dose anthracycline regimens is \ncurrently limited to the trial MO16432. \nIn the pivotal trial MO16432, trastuzumab was administered concurrently with neoadjuvant \nchemotherapy containing three cycles of doxorubicin (cumulative dose 180 mg/m2). \nThe incidence of symptomatic cardiac dysfunction was 1.7 % in the trastuzumab arm. \nClinical experience is limited in patients above 65 years of age. \nInfusion-related reactions (IRRs) and hypersensitivity \nSerious IRRs to trastuzumab infusion including dyspnoea, hypotension, wheezing, hypertension, \nbronchospasm, supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, reduced oxygen saturation, anaphylaxis, respiratory \ndistress, urticaria and angioedema have been reported (see section 4.8). Pre-medication may be used to \nreduce risk of occurrence of these events. The majority of these events occur during or within 2.5 \nhours of the start of the first infusion. Should an infusion reaction occur the infusion should be \ndiscontinued or the rate of infusion slowed and the patient should be monitored until resolution of all \nobserved symptoms (see section 4.2). These symptoms can be treated with an analgesic/antipyretic \nsuch as meperidine or paracetamol, or an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine. The majority of \npatients experienced resolution of symptoms and subsequently received further infusions of \ntrastuzumab. Serious reactions have been treated successfully with supportive therapy such as oxygen, \nbeta agonists, and corticosteroids. In rare cases, these reactions are associated with a clinical course \nculminating in a fatal outcome. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of \nadvanced malignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of a fatal infusion reaction. \nTherefore, these patients should not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). \nInitial improvement followed by clinical deterioration and delayed reactions with rapid clinical \ndeterioration have also been reported. Fatalities have occurred within hours and up to one week \nfollowing infusion. On very rare occasions, patients have experienced the onset of infusion symptoms \nand pulmonary symptoms more than six hours after the start of the trastuzumab infusion. Patients \nshould be warned of the possibility of such a late onset and should be instructed to contact their \nphysician if these symptoms occur. \nPulmonary events \nSevere pulmonary events have been reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing setting \n(see section 4.8). These events have occasionally been fatal. In addition, cases of interstitial lung \ndisease including lung infiltrates, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis, \npleural effusion, respiratory distress, acute pulmonary oedema and respiratory insufficiency have been \nreported. Risk factors associated with interstitial lung disease include prior or concomitant therapy \nwith other anti-neoplastic therapies known to be associated with it such as taxanes, gemcitabine, \nvinorelbine and radiation therapy. These events may occur as part of an infusion-related reaction or \nwith a delayed onset. Patients experiencing dyspnoea at rest due to complications of advanced \nmalignancy and comorbidities may be at increased risk of pulmonary events. Therefore, these patients \nshould not be treated with trastuzumab (see section 4.3). Caution should be exercised for pneumonitis, \nespecially in patients being treated concomitantly with taxanes. \nExcipients \nSorbitol content \nOgivri 150 mg contains 115.2 mg sorbitol in each vial.  \nOgivri 420 mg contains 322.6 mg sorbitol in each vial. \nPatients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given this medicine unless strictly \nnecessary. \nA detailed history with regards to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given \nthis medicinal product. \nSodium \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say, essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.", "pregnancy": "No interaction studies have been performed. Clinically significant interactions between trastuzumab \nand the concomitant medicinal products used in clinical trials have not been observed. \nEffect of trastuzumab on the pharmacokinetics of other antineoplastic agents \nPharmacokinetic data from studies BO15935 and M77004 in women with HER2-positive MBC \nsuggested that exposure to paclitaxel and doxorubicin (and their major metabolites 6-\u03b1 hydroxyl-\npaclitaxel, POH, and doxorubicinol, DOL) was not altered in the presence of trastuzumab (8 mg/kg or \n4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose followed by 6 mg/kg q3w or 2 mg/kg q1w intravenous, \nrespectively). \nHowever, trastuzumab may elevate the overall exposure of one doxorubicin metabolite, (7-deoxy-13 \ndihydro-doxorubicinone, D7D). The bioactivity of D7D and the clinical impact of the elevation of this \nmetabolite were unclear. \nData from study JP16003, a single-arm study of trastuzumab (4 mg/kg intravenous loading dose and \n2 mg/kg intravenous weekly) and docetaxel (60 mg/m2 intravenous) in Japanese women with HER2- \npositive MBC, suggested that concomitant administration of trastuzumab had no effect on the single \ndose pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. Study JP19959 was a sub study of BO18255 (ToGA) performed \nin male and female Japanese patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) to study the \npharmacokinetics of capecitabine and cisplatin when used with or without trastuzumab. The results of \nthis sub study suggested that the exposure to the bioactive metabolites (e.g. 5-FU) of capecitabine was \nnot affected by concurrent use of cisplatin or by concurrent use of cisplatin plus trastuzumab. \nHowever, capecitabine itself showed higher concentrations and a longer half-life when combined with \ntrastuzumab. The data also suggested that the pharmacokinetics of cisplatin were not affected by \nconcurrent use of capecitabine or by concurrent use of capecitabine plus trastuzumab. \n10 \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 in patients with metastatic or locally advanced \ninoperable HER2-positive cancer suggested that trastuzumab had no impact on the PK of carboplatin. \nEffect of antineoplastic agents on trastuzumab pharmacokinetics  \nBy comparison of simulated serum trastuzumab concentrations after trastuzumab monotherapy \n(4 mg/kg loading/2 mg/kg q1w intravenous) and observed serum concentrations in Japanese women \nwith HER2- positive MBC (study JP16003) no evidence of a PK effect of concurrent administration of \ndocetaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab was found. \nComparison of PK results from two phase II studies (BO15935 and M77004) and one phase III study \n(H0648g) in which patients were treated concomitantly with trastuzumab and paclitaxel and two phase \nII studies in which trastuzumab was administered as monotherapy (W016229 and MO16982), in \nwomen with HER2-positive MBC indicates that individual and mean trastuzumab trough serum \nconcentrations varied within and across studies but there was no clear effect of the concomitant \nadministration of paclitaxel on the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. Comparison of trastuzumab PK \ndata from Study M77004 in which women with HER2-positive MBC were treated concomitantly with \ntrastuzumab, paclitaxel and doxorubicin to trastuzumab PK data in studies where trastuzumab was \nadministered as monotherapy (H0649g) or in combination with anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide \nor paclitaxel (Study H0648g), suggested no effect of doxorubicin and paclitaxel on the \npharmacokinetics of trastuzumab. \nPharmacokinetic data from Study H4613g/GO01305 suggested that carboplatin had no impact on the \nPK of trastuzumab. \nThe administration of concomitant anastrozole did not appear to influence the pharmacokinetics of \ntrastuzumab.", "driving": "Women of childbearing potential \nWomen of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment \nwith trastuzumab and for 7 months after treatment has concluded (see section 5.2). \nPregnancy \nReproduction studies have been conducted in Cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 25 times that of the \nweekly human maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg trastuzumab intravenous formulation and have revealed \nno evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the foetus.

Patients co-infected with HIV and HBV who discontinue \nBiktarvy should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several \nmonths after stopping treatment. \nLiver disease \nThe safety and efficacy of Biktarvy in patients with significant underlying liver disorders have not \nbeen established. \nPatients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased \nfrequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy (CART) and \nshould be monitored according to standard practice.  If there is evidence of worsening liver disease in \nsuch patients, interruption or discontinuation of treatment must be considered. \nWeight and metabolic parameters \nAn increase in weight and in levels of blood lipids and glucose may occur during antiretroviral \ntherapy.  Such changes may in part be linked to disease control and lifestyle.  For lipids, there is in \nsome cases evidence for a treatment effect, while for weight gain there is no strong evidence relating \nthis to any particular treatment.  For monitoring of blood lipids and glucose, reference is made to \nestablished HIV treatment guidelines.  Lipid disorders should be managed as clinically appropriate. \nMitochondrial dysfunction following exposure \nin utero\nNucleos(t)ide analogues may impact mitochondrial function to a variable degree, which is most \npronounced with stavudine, didanosine and zidovudine.  There have been reports of mitochondrial \ndysfunction in HIV negative infants exposed \nin utero\n and/or postnatally to nucleoside analogues; these \nhave predominantly concerned treatment with regimens containing zidovudine.  The main adverse \nreactions reported are haematological disorders (anaemia, neutropenia) and metabolic disorders \n(hyperlactatemia, hyperlipasemia).  These events have often been transitory.  Late onset neurological \ndisorders have been reported rarely (hypertonia, convulsion, abnormal behaviour).  Whether such \nneurological disorders are transient or permanent is currently unknown.  These findings should be \nconsidered for any child exposed \nin utero\n to nucleos(t)ide analogues, who present with severe clinical \nfindings of unknown aetiology, particularly neurologic findings.  These findings do not affect current \nnational recommendations to use antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women to prevent vertical \ntransmission of HIV. \nImmune Reactivation Syndrome \nIn HIV infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of CART, an \ninflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause \nserious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.  Typically, such reactions have been observed \nwithin the first few weeks or months of initiation of CART.  Relevant examples include \ncytomegalovirus retinitis, generalised and/or focal mycobacterial infections, and \nPneumocystis \njirovecii\n pneumonia.  Any inflammatory symptoms should be evaluated and treatment instituted when \nnecessary. \nAutoimmune disorders (such as Graves\u2019 disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have also been reported to \noccur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and \nthese events can occur many months after initiation of treatment. \nOpportunistic infections \nPatients should be advised that Biktarvy or any other antiretroviral therapy does not cure \nHIV infection and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of \nHIV infection.  Therefore, patients should remain under close clinical observation by physicians \nexperienced in the treatment of patients with HIV associated diseases. \nOsteonecrosis \nAlthough the aetiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol \nconsumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been \nreported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and/or long-term exposure to CART.  \nPatients should be advised to seek medical advice if they experience joint aches and pain, joint \nstiffness or difficulty in movement. \nNephrotoxicity \nPost-marketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure and proximal renal \ntubulopathy have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide-containing products.  A potential risk of \nnephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to dosing with tenofovir \nalafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). \nIt is recommended that renal function is assessed in all patients prior to, or when initiating, therapy \nwith Biktarvy and that it is also monitored during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate.  In \npatients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function, or evidence of proximal renal \ntubulopathy, discontinuation of Biktarvy should be considered. \nPatients with end stage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis \nBiktarvy should generally be avoided but may be used in adults with end stage renal disease \n(estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis if the potential benefits outweigh the \npotential risks (see section 4.2).  In a study of emtricitabine + tenofovir alafenamide in combination \nwith elvitegravir + cobicistat as a fixed-dose combination tablet (E/C/F/TAF) in HIV-1 infected adults \nwith end stage renal disease (estimated CrCl < 15 mL/min) on chronic haemodialysis, efficacy was \nmaintained through 96 weeks but emtricitabine exposure was significantly higher than in patients with \nnormal renal function.  Efficacy was also maintained in the extension phase of the study in which 10 \npatients switched to Biktarvy for 48 weeks.  Although no additional adverse reactions were identified, \nthe implications of increased emtricitabine exposure remain uncertain (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). \nCo-administration of other medicinal products \nBiktarvy should not be co-administered simultaneously with magnesium/aluminium-containing \nantacids or iron supplements under fasted conditions.  Biktarvy should be administered at least 2 hours \nbefore, or with food 2 hours after antacids containing magnesium and/or aluminium.  Biktarvy should \nbe administered at least 2 hours before iron supplements, or taken together with food (see section 4.5). \nSome medicinal products are not recommended for co-administration with Biktarvy: atazanavir, \ncarbamazepine, ciclosporin (IV or oral use), oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, \nrifapentine, or sucralfate. \nBiktarvy should not be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. \nPaediatric population \nReductions in bone mineral density (BMD \u2265 4%) of the spine and total body less head (TBLH) have \nbeen reported in patients aged between 3 to < 12 years who received tenofovir alafenamide-containing \nproducts for 48 weeks (see section 4.8).  The long-term effects of changes in BMD on the growing \nbone, including the risk of fracture, are uncertain.  A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to \ndecide the appropriate monitoring during treatment. \nExcipients\nThis medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially \n\u2018sodium-free\u2019.", "pregnancy": "Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. \nBiktarvy should not be administered concomitantly with medicinal products containing tenofovir \nalafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil, lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil used for the treatment of \nHBV infection. \nBictegravir \nBictegravir\nis a substrate of CYP3A and UGT1A1.  Co-administration of bictegravir and medicinal \nproducts that potently induce both CYP3A and UGT1A1, such as rifampicin or St. John\u2019s wort, may \nsignificantly decrease plasma concentrations of bictegravir, which may result in a loss of therapeutic \neffect of Biktarvy and development of resistance, therefore co-administration is contraindicated (see \nsection 4.3).  Co-administration of bictegravir with medicinal products that potently inhibit both \nCYP3A and UGT1A1, such as atazanavir, may significantly increase plasma concentrations of \nbictegravir, therefore co-administration is not recommended.  \nBictegravir is both a P-gp and a BCRP substrate.  The clinical relevance of this feature is not \nestablished.  Therefore, caution is recommended when bictegravir is combined with medicinal \nproducts known to inhibit P-gp and/or BCRP (e.g. macrolides, ciclosporin, verapamil, dronedarone, \nglecaprevir/pibrentasvir) (see also table below). \nBictegravir\ninhibits organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion \ntransporter 1 (MATE1) \nin vitro\n.

Biktarvy may be \nco-administered with substrates of OCT2 and MATE1.  \nBictegravir\nis not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP \nin vivo\nEmtricitabine \nIn vitro\n and clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies have shown that the potential for \nCYP-mediated interactions involving emtricitabine with other medicinal products is low.  \nCo-administration of emtricitabine with medicinal products that are eliminated by active tubular \nsecretion may increase concentrations of emtricitabine, and/or the co-administered medicinal product.  \nMedicinal products that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of emtricitabine. \nTenofovir alafenamide \nTenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein \n(BCRP).  Co-administration of Biktarvy with medicinal products that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP \nactivity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption.  Medicinal products that induce \nP-gp activity (e.g. rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are expected to decrease the absorption of \ntenofovir alafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide, which \nmay lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Biktarvy and development of resistance.

Alternatively, 50 mg given twice weekly may be used for up to 12 weeks followed, if \nnecessary, by a dose of 25 mg twice weekly or 50 mg once weekly. Treatment with Enbrel should \ncontinue until remission is achieved, for up to 24 weeks. Continuous therapy beyond 24 weeks may be \nappropriate for some adult patients (see section 5.1). Treatment should be discontinued in patients who \nshow no response after 12 weeks. If re-treatment with Enbrel is indicated, the same guidance on \ntreatment duration should be followed.

In evaluating patients for infections, the \npatient\u2019s risk for relevant opportunistic infections (e.g., exposure to endemic mycoses) should be \nconsidered. \nPatients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Enbrel should be monitored \nclosely. Administration of Enbrel should be discontinued if a patient develops a serious infection. The \nsafety and efficacy of Enbrel in patients with chronic infections have not been evaluated. Physicians \nshould exercise caution when considering the use of Enbrel in patients with a history of recurring or \nchronic infections or with underlying conditions that may predispose patients to infections, such as \nadvanced or poorly controlled diabetes.\nTuberculosis\nCases of active tuberculosis, including miliary tuberculosis and tuberculosis with extra-pulmonary \nlocation, have been reported in patients treated with Enbrel.\nBefore starting treatment with Enbrel, all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive \n(\u2018latent\u2019) tuberculosis. This evaluation should include a detailed medical history with personal history \nof tuberculosis or possible previous contact with tuberculosis and previous and/or current \nimmunosuppressive therapy. Appropriate screening tests, i.e., tuberculin skin test and chest X-ray, \nshould be performed in all patients (local recommendations may apply). It is recommended that the \nconduct of these tests should be recorded in the Patient Card. Prescribers are reminded of the risk of \nfalse negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are severely ill or \nimmunocompromised.\nIf active tuberculosis is diagnosed, Enbrel therapy must not be initiated. If inactive (\u2018latent\u2019) \ntuberculosis is diagnosed, treatment for latent tuberculosis must be started with anti-tuberculosis \ntherapy before the initiation of Enbrel, and in accordance with local recommendations. In this \nsituation, the benefit/risk balance of Enbrel therapy should be very carefully considered.\nAll patients should be informed to seek medical advice if signs/symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis \n(e.g., persistent cough, wasting/weight loss, low-grade fever) appear during or after Enbrel treatment.\nHepatitis B reactivation\nReactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were previously infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) \nand had received concomitant TNF-antagonists, including Enbrel, has been reported. This includes \nreports of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients who were anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative.\nPatients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with Enbrel. For patients who \ntest positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of \nhepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when administering Enbrel in patients \npreviously infected with HBV. These patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active \nHBV infection throughout therapy and for several weeks following termination of therapy. Adequate \ndata from treating patients infected with HBV with anti-viral therapy in conjunction with \nTNF-antagonist therapy are not available. In patients who develop HBV infection, Enbrel should be \nstopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.\nWorsening of hepatitis C\nThere have been reports of worsening of hepatitis C in patients receiving Enbrel. Enbrel should be \nused with caution in patients with a history of hepatitis C.\nConcurrent treatment with anakinra \nConcurrent administration of Enbrel and anakinra has been associated with an increased risk of serious \ninfections and neutropenia compared to Enbrel alone. This combination has not demonstrated \nincreased clinical benefit. Thus, the combined use of Enbrel and anakinra is not recommended (see \nsections 4.5 and 4.8).\nConcurrent treatment with abatacept \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and Enbrel resulted in increased incidences \nof serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use \nis not recommended (see section 4.5).\nAllergic reactions\nAllergic reactions associated with Enbrel administration have been reported commonly. Allergic \nreactions have included angioedema and urticaria; serious reactions have occurred. If any serious \nallergic or anaphylactic reaction occurs, Enbrel therapy should be discontinued immediately and\nappropriate therapy initiated.\nImmunosuppression\nThe possibility exists for TNF-antagonists, including Enbrel, to affect host defences against infections \nand malignancies since TNF mediates inflammation and modulates cellular immune responses. In a \nstudy of 49 adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with Enbrel, there was no evidence of \ndepression of delayed-type hypersensitivity, depression of immunoglobulin levels, or change in \nenumeration of effector cell populations.\nTwo juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients developed varicella infection and signs and symptoms of \naseptic meningitis, which resolved without sequelae. Patients with a significant exposure to varicella \nvirus should temporarily discontinue Enbrel therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with \nVaricella Zoster Immune Globulin.\nThe safety and efficacy of Enbrel in patients with immunosuppression have not been evaluated.\nMalignancies and lymphoproliferative disorders\nSolid and haematopoietic malignancies (excluding skin cancers)\nReports of various malignancies (including breast and lung carcinoma and lymphoma) have been \nreceived in the postmarketing period (see section 4.8). \nIn the controlled portions of clinical trials of TNF-antagonists, more cases of lymphoma have been \nobserved among patients receiving a TNF-antagonist compared with control patients. However, the \noccurrence was rare, and the follow-up period of placebo patients was shorter than for patients \nreceiving TNF-antagonist therapy. In the postmarketing setting, cases of leukaemia have been reported \nin patients treated with TNF-antagonists. There is an increased background risk for lymphoma and \nleukaemia in rheumatoid arthritis patients with long-standing, highly active, inflammatory disease, \nwhich complicates risk estimation.\nBased on current knowledge, a possible risk for the development of lymphomas, leukaemia or other \nhaematopoietic or solid malignancies in patients treated with a TNF-antagonist cannot be excluded. \nCaution should be exercised when considering TNF-antagonist therapy for patients with a history of \nmalignancy or when considering continuing treatment in patients who develop a malignancy.\nMalignancies, some fatal, have been reported among children, adolescents and young adults (up to \n22 years of age) treated with TNF-antagonists (initiation of therapy \u2264 18 years of age), including \nEnbrel, in the postmarketing setting. Approximately half the cases were lymphomas. The other cases \nrepresented a variety of different malignancies and included rare malignancies typically associated \nwith immunosuppression. A risk for the development of malignancies in children and adolescents \ntreated with TNF-antagonists cannot be excluded.\nSkin cancers\nMelanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) have been reported in patients treated with \nTNF-antagonists, including Enbrel. Postmarketing cases of Merkel cell carcinoma have been reported \nvery infrequently in patients treated with Enbrel. Periodic skin examination is recommended for all \npatients, particularly those with risk factors for skin cancer.\nCombining the results of controlled clinical trials, more cases of NMSC were observed in patients \nreceiving Enbrel compared with control patients, particularly in patients with psoriasis.\nVaccinations\nLive vaccines should not be given concurrently with Enbrel. No data are available on the secondary \ntransmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Enbrel. In a double-blind, \nplacebo-controlled, randomised clinical study in adult patients with psoriatic arthritis, 184 patients also \nreceived a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at week 4. In this study, most psoriatic \narthritis patients receiving Enbrel were able to mount effective B-cell immune response to \npneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titres in aggregate were moderately lower, and few patients \nhad two-fold rises in titres compared to patients not receiving Enbrel. The clinical significance of this \nis unknown.\nAutoantibody formation\nTreatment with Enbrel may result in the formation of autoimmune antibodies (see section 4.8).\nHaematologic reactions\nRare cases of pancytopenia and very rare cases of aplastic anaemia, some with fatal outcome, have \nbeen reported in patients treated with Enbrel. Caution should be exercised in patients being treated \nwith Enbrel who have a previous history of blood dyscrasias. All patients and parents/caregivers \nshould be advised that if the patient develops signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or \ninfections (e.g., persistent fever, sore throat, bruising, bleeding, paleness) whilst on Enbrel, they \nshould seek immediate medical advice. Such patients should be investigated urgently, including full \nblood count; if blood dyscrasias are confirmed, Enbrel should be discontinued.\nNeurological disorders\nThere have been rare reports of CNS demyelinating disorders in patients treated with Enbrel (see \nsection 4.8). Additionally, there have been rare reports of peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies \n(including Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, \ndemyelinating polyneuropathy, and multifocal motor neuropathy). Although no clinical trials have \nbeen performed evaluating Enbrel therapy in patients with multiple sclerosis, clinical trials of other \nTNF antagonists in patients with multiple sclerosis have shown increases in disease activity. A careful \nrisk/benefit evaluation, including a neurologic assessment, is recommended when prescribing Enbrel \nto patients with pre-existing or recent onset of demyelinating disease, or to those who are considered \nto have an increased risk of developing demyelinating disease.\nCombination therapy\nIn a controlled clinical trial of two years duration in rheumatoid arthritis patients, the combination of \nEnbrel and methotrexate did not result in unexpected safety findings, and the safety profile of Enbrel \nwhen given in combination with methotrexate was similar to the profiles reported in studies of Enbrel \nand methotrexate alone. Long-term studies to assess the safety of the combination are ongoing. The \nlong-term safety of Enbrel in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs \n(DMARD) has not been established.\nThe use of Enbrel in combination with other systemic therapies or phototherapy for the treatment of \npsoriasis has not been studied.\nRenal and hepatic impairment\nBased on pharmacokinetic data (see section 5.2), no dose adjustment is needed in patients with renal \nor hepatic impairment; clinical experience in such patients is limited.\nCongestive heart failure (Cardiac failure congestive)\nPhysicians should use caution when using Enbrel in patients who have congestive heart failure (CHF). \nThere have been postmarketing reports of worsening of CHF, with and without identifiable \nprecipitating factors, in patients taking Enbrel. There have also been rare (< 0.1%) reports of new \nonset CHF, including CHF in patients without known pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Some of \nthese patients have been under 50 years of age. Two large clinical trials evaluating the use of Enbrel in \nthe treatment of CHF were terminated early due to lack of efficacy. Although not conclusive, data \nfrom one of these trials suggest a possible tendency toward worsening CHF in those patients assigned \nto Enbrel treatment. \nAlcoholic hepatitis\nIn a phase II randomised placebo-controlled study of 48 hospitalised patients treated with Enbrel or \nplacebo for moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, Enbrel was not efficacious, and the mortality rate in \npatients treated with Enbrel was significantly higher after 6 months. Consequently, Enbrel should not \nbe used in patients for the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis. Physicians should use caution when using \nEnbrel in patients who also have moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis.\nWegener's granulomatosis\nA placebo-controlled trial, in which 89 adult patients were treated with Enbrel in addition to standard \ntherapy (including cyclophosphamide or methotrexate, and glucocorticoids) for a median duration of \n25 months, has not shown Enbrel to be an effective treatment for Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis. The \nincidence of non-cutaneous malignancies of various types was significantly higher in patients treated \nwith Enbrel than in the control group. Enbrel is not recommended for the treatment of Wegener\u2019s \ngranulomatosis.\nHypoglycaemia in patients treated for diabetes\nThere have been reports of hypoglycaemia following initiation of Enbrel in patients receiving \nmedication for diabetes, necessitating a reduction in anti-diabetic medication in some of these patients.\nSpecial populations\nElderly\nIn the Phase 3 studies in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, no overall \ndifferences in adverse events, serious adverse events, and serious infections in patients age 65 or older \nwho received Enbrel were observed compared with younger patients. However, caution should be \nexercised when treating the elderly and particular attention paid with respect to occurrence of \ninfections.\nPaediatric population\nVaccinations\nIt is recommended that paediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunisations in \nagreement with current immunisation guidelines prior to initiating Enbrel therapy (see Vaccinations, \nabove).", "pregnancy": "Concurrent treatment with anakinra \nAdult patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfection when compared with patients treated with either Enbrel or anakinra alone (historical data).\nIn addition, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adult patients receiving background \nmethotrexate, patients treated with Enbrel and anakinra were observed to have a higher rate of serious \ninfections (7%) and neutropenia than patients treated with Enbrel (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The \ncombination Enbrel and anakinra has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit, and is therefore not \nrecommended.\nConcurrent treatment with abatacept \nIn clinical studies, concurrent administration of abatacept and Enbrel resulted in increased incidences \nof serious adverse events. This combination has not demonstrated increased clinical benefit; such use \nis not recommended (see section 4.4). \nConcurrent treatment with sulfasalazine \nIn a clinical study of adult patients who were receiving established doses of sulfasalazine, to which \nEnbrel was added, patients in the combination group experienced a statistically significant decrease in \nmean white blood cell counts in comparison to groups treated with Enbrel or sulfasalazine alone. The \nclinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Physicians should use caution when considering \ncombination therapy with sulfasalazine.\nNon-interactions\nIn clinical trials, no interactions have been observed when Enbrel was administered with \nglucocorticoids, salicylates (except sulfasalazine), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), \nanalgesics, or methotrexate. See section 4.4 for vaccination advice.\nNo clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions were observed in studies with \nmethotrexate, digoxin or warfarin.", "driving": "Women of childbearing potential\nWomen of childbearing potential should consider the use of appropriate contraception to avoid \nbecoming pregnant during Enbrel therapy and for three weeks after discontinuation of therapy.\nPregnancy \nDevelopmental toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of harm to the \nfoetus or neonatal rat due to etanercept. The effects of etanercept on pregnancy outcomes have been \ninvestigated in two observational cohort studies. A higher rate of major birth defects was observed in \none observational study comparing pregnancies exposed to etanercept (n=370) during the first \ntrimester with pregnancies not exposed to etanercept or other TNF-antagonists (n=164) (adjusted odds \nratio 2.4, 95% CI: 1.0-5.5). The types of major birth defects were consistent with those most \ncommonly reported in the general population and no particular pattern of abnormalities was identified. \nNo change in the rate of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or minor malformations was observed. In \nanother observational multi-country registry study comparing the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes \nin women exposed to etanercept during the first 90 days of pregnancy (n=425) to those exposed to \nnon-biologic drugs (n=3497), there was no observed increased risk of major birth defects (crude odds \nratio [OR]= 1.22, 95% CI: 0.79-1.90; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.58-1.60 after adjusting for \ncountry, maternal disease, parity, maternal age and smoking in early pregnancy). This study also \nshowed no increased risks of minor birth defects, preterm birth, stillbirth, or infections in the first year \nof life for infants born to women exposed to etanercept during pregnancy. Enbrel should only be used \nduring pregnancy if clearly needed.\nEtanercept crosses the placenta and has been detected in the serum of infants born to female patients \ntreated with Enbrel during pregnancy. The clinical impact of this is unknown, however, infants may be \nat increased risk of infection. Administration of live vaccines to infants for 16 weeks after the \nmother\u2019s last dose of Enbrel is generally not recommended.\nBreast-feeding\nIn lactating rats following subcutaneous administration, etanercept was excreted in the milk and \ndetected in the serum of pups. Limited information from the published literature indicates etanercept \nhas been detected at low levels in human milk. Etanercept could be considered for use during \nbreast-feeding taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy \nfor the woman.\nWhile systemic exposure in a breastfed infant is expected to be low because etanercept is largely \ndegraded in the gastrointestinal tract, limited data regarding systemic exposure in the breastfed infant \nare available. Therefore, the administration of live vaccines (e.g., BCG) to a breastfed infant when the \nmother is receiving etanercept could be considered 16 weeks after stopping breast-feeding (or at an \nearlier timepoint if the infant etanercept serum levels are undetectable). \nFertility\nPreclinical data about peri- and postnatal toxicity of etanercept and of effects of etanercept on fertility \nand general reproductive performance are not available.", "side_effects": "Enbrel has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.", "shelf_life": "4 years.\nChemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at temperatures of up to \n\uf0b0C after reconstitution.

If orlistat is taken \nwith a meal very high in fat, the possibility of gastrointestinal adverse reactions may increase.  \nCases of rectal bleeding have been reported with Xenical. Prescribers should investigate further in \ncase of severe and/or persistent symptoms. \nThe use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral \ncontraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5). \nCoagulation parameters should be monitored in patients treated with concomitant oral anticoagulants \n(see section 4.5 and 4.8). \nThe use of orlistat may be associated with hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy leading sometimes \nto renal failure. This risk is increased in patients with underlying chronic kidney disease and/or \nvolume depletion (see section 4.8). \nRare occurrence of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur.

This can lead to a decrease of \nimmunosuppressive efficacy. Therefore the combination is not recommended (see section 4.4). \nHowever, if such concomitant use is unavoidable, more frequent monitoring of ciclosporin blood \nlevels should be performed both after addition of orlistat and upon discontinuation of orlistat in \nciclosporin treated patients. Ciclosporin blood levels should be monitored until stabilised. \nAcarbose  \nIn the absence of pharmacokinetic interaction studies, the concomitant administration of orlistat with \nacarbose should be avoided.  \nOral anticoagulants \nWhen warfarin or other anticoagulants are given in combination with orlistat, international normalised \nratio (INR) values should be monitored (see section 4.4). \nFat soluble vitamins\nTreatment with orlistat may potentially impair the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K). \nThe vast majority of patients receiving up to four full years of treatment with orlistat in clinical studies \nhad vitamin A, D, E and K and beta-carotene levels that stayed within normal range. In order to ensure \nadequate nutrition, patients on a weight control diet should be advised to have a diet rich in fruit and \nvegetables and use of a multivitamin supplement could be considered. If a multivitamin supplement is \nrecommended, it should be taken at least two hours after the administration of orlistat or at bedtime. \nAmiodarone\nA slight decrease in plasma levels of amiodarone, when given as a single dose, has been observed in a \nlimited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly. In patients receiving \namiodarone treatment, the clinical relevance of this effect remains unknown but may become \nclinically relevant in some cases. In patients receiving concomitant amiodarone treatment, \nreinforcement of clinical and ECG monitoring is warranted. \nConvulsions have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and antiepileptic drugs \ne.g. valproate, lamotrigine, for which a causal relationship to an interaction cannot be excluded. \nTherefore, these patients should be monitored for possible changes in the frequency and/or severity of \nconvulsions.  \nRare occurrence of hypothyroidism and/or reduced control of hypothyroidism may occur. The \nmechanism, although not proven, may involve a decreased absorption of iodine salts and/or \nlevothyroxine (see section 4.4). \nThere are some case reports of reduced efficacy of antiretroviral HIV medicines, antidepressants \nantipsychotics (including lithium) and benzodiazepines coincidental to the initiation of orlistat \ntreatment in previously well-controlled patients.

It is preferable that the prandial \ninjection is performed before the same meal every day, when the most convenient meal has been chosen.  \nDose titration\nSuliqua is to be dosed in accordance with the individual patient's need for insulin. It is recommended \nto optimise glycaemic control via dose adjustment based on fasting plasma glucose (see section 5.1). \nClose glucose monitoring is recommended during the transfer and in the following weeks. \nIf the patient starts with the Suliqua (10-40) pen, the dose may be titrated up to 40 dose steps with \nthis pen. \nFor doses >40 dose steps/day titration must be continued with Suliqua (30-60) pen. \nIf the patient starts with the Suliqua (30-60) pen, the dose may be titrated up to 60 dose steps with \nthis pen.  \nFor total daily doses >60 dose steps/day, Suliqua must not be used. \nPatients adjusting the amount or timing of dosing should only do so under medical supervision with \nappropriate glucose monitoring (see section 4.4).  \nMissed dose \nIf a dose of Suliqua is missed, it should be injected within the hour prior to the next meal. \nSpecial population  \nElderly  \nSuliqua can be used in elderly patients. The dose should be adjusted on an individual basis, based on \nglucose monitoring. In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady \ndecrease in insulin requirements. For lixisenatide no dose adjustment is required based on age. The \ntherapeutic experience of Suliqua in patients \u226575 years of age is limited. \nRenal impairment \nSuliqua is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease as \nthere is no sufficient therapeutic experience with use of lixisenatide.  \nNo dose adjustment is required for lixisenatide in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment.  \nIn patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin \nmetabolism.\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment using Suliqua, frequent glucose monitoring and \ndose adjustment may be necessary. \nHepatic impairment \nNo dose adjustment of lixisenatide is needed in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). In \npatients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for \ngluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism. Frequent glucose monitoring and dose adjustment \nmay be necessary for Suliqua in patients with hepatic impairment\nPaediatric population \nThere is no relevant use of Suliqua in the paediatric population. \nMethod of administration  \nSuliqua is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, deltoid, or thigh. \nThe injection sites should be rotated within the same region (abdomen, deltoid, or thigh) from one \ninjection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see \nsection 4.4 and 4.8). \nPatients should be instructed to always use a new needle. The re-use of insulin pen needles increases \nthe risk of blocked needles, which may cause under- or overdosing. In the event of blocked needles, \npatients must follow the instructions described in the Instructions for Use accompanying the package \nleaflet (see section 6.6). \nSuliqua must not be drawn from the cartridge of the pre-filled pen into a syringe to avoid dosing errors \nand potential overdose (see section 4.4).", "contraindications": "Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.", "special_warnings": "Traceability  \nIn order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number \nof the administered product should be clearly recorded. \nType 1 diabetes mellitus \nSuliqua should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic \nketoacidosis. \nRotation of the injection site \nPatients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of \ndeveloping lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin \nabsorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions.

Caution should be exercised in patients \nwith a history of pancreatitis. \nSevere gastrointestinal disease  \nUse of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions (see \nsection 4.8). Suliqua has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including \nsevere gastroparesis and therefore, the use of Suliqua is not recommended in these patients.   \nSevere renal impairment  \nThere is no therapeutic experience in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less \nthan 30 ml/min) or end-stage renal disease. Use is not recommended in patients with severe renal \nimpairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). \nConcomitant medicinal products  \nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \nadministered medicinal products. Suliqua should be used with caution in patients receiving oral \nmedicinal products that require rapid gastrointestinal absorption, require careful clinical monitoring or \nhave a narrow therapeutic ratio. Specific recommendations regarding intake of such medicinal \nproducts are given in section 4.5. \nDehydration  \nPatients treated with Suliqua should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration in relation to \ngastrointestinal adverse reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion. \nAntibody formation  \nAdministration of Suliqua may cause formation of antibodies against insulin glargine and/or \nlixisenatide. In rare cases, the presence of such antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the Suliqua \ndose in order to correct a tendency for hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia. \nAvoidance of medication errors  \nPatients must be instructed to always check the pen label before each injection to avoid accidental \nmix-ups between the two different strengths of Suliqua and mix-ups with other injectable diabetes \nmedicinal products. \nTo avoid dosing errors and potential overdose, neither the patients nor healthcare professionals should \never use a syringe to draw the medicinal product from the cartridge in the pre-filled pen into a syringe. \nAntidiabetic medicinal products not studied in combination with Suliqua   \nSuliqua has not been studied in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, \nsulfonylureas, glinides, and pioglitazone. \nTravel \nTo avoid dosing errors and potential overdoses with changing to different time zones, the patient \nshould seek the doctor\u2019s advice before travelling. \nExcipients  \nThis medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially \n'sodium-free'. \nThis medicinal product contains metacresol, which may cause allergic reactions.", "pregnancy": "No interaction studies with Suliqua have been performed. The information given below is based on \nstudies with the monocomponents.  \nPharmacodynamic interactions  \nA number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of Suliqua. \nSubstances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to \nhypoglycaemia include anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme \n(ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, \npentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulphonamide antibiotics. \nSubstances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, \ndiazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, \nsomatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, \nterbutaline), thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. clozapine and \nolanzapine) and protease inhibitors. \nBeta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the \nblood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may \nsometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. \nIn addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, \nguanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. \nPharmacokinetic interactions  \nLixisenatide is a peptide and is not metabolised by cytochrome P450. In \nin vitro\n studies, lixisenatide \ndid not affect the activity of cytochrome P450 isozymes or human transporters tested. \nNo pharmacokinetic interactions are known for insulin glargine. \nEffect of gastric emptying on oral medicinal products \nThe delay of gastric emptying with lixisenatide may reduce the rate of absorption of orally \nadministered medicinal products. Patients receiving medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic \nratio or medicinal products that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely, \nespecially at the time of initiation of lixisenatide treatment. These medicinal products should be taken \nin a standardised way in relation to lixisenatide. If such medicinal products are to be administered with \nfood, patients should be advised to, if possible, take them with a meal when lixisenatide is not \nadministered. \nFor oral medicinal products that are particularly dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy, \nsuch as antibiotics, patients should be advised to take those medicinal products at least 1 hour before \nor 4 hours after lixisenatide injection. \nGastro-resistant formulations containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation, should be \nadministered 1 hour before or 4 hours after lixisenatide injection.  \nParacetamol\nParacetamol was used as a model medicinal product to evaluate the effect of lixisenatide on gastric \nemptying. Following administration of a single dose of paracetamol 1000 mg, paracetamol AUC and \nt1/2 were unchanged whatever the timing of its administration (before or after the lixisenatide \ninjection). When administered 1 or 4 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, Cmax of paracetamol was \ndecreased by 29% and 31%, respectively and median tmax was delayed by 2.0 and 1.75 hours, \nrespectively. A further delay in tmax and a reduced Cmax of paracetamol have been predicted with the \n20 mcg maintenance dose. \nNo effects on paracetamol Cmax and tmax were observed when paracetamol was administered 1 hour \nbefore lixisenatide. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for paracetamol is required but the delayed tmax observed \nwhen paracetamol is administered 1-4 hours after lixisenatide should be taken into account when a \nrapid onset of action is required for efficacy. \nOral contraceptives \nFollowing administration of a single dose of an oral contraceptive medicinal product (ethinylestradiol \n0.03 mg/levonorgestrel 0.15 mg) 1 hour before or 11 hours after 10 mcg lixisenatide, the Cmax, AUC, \nt1/2 and tmax of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel were unchanged. \nAdministration of the oral contraceptive 1 hour or 4 hours after lixisenatide did not affect AUC and \nt1/2 of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, whereas Cmax of ethinylestradiol was decreased by 52% and \n39%, respectively and Cmax of levonorgestrel was decreased by 46% and 20%, respectively and \nmedian tmax was delayed by 1 to 3 hours. \nThe reduction in Cmax is of limited clinical relevance and no dose adjustment for oral contraceptives is \nrequired. \nAtorvastatin \nWhen lixisenatide 20 mcg and atorvastatin 40 mg were co-administered in the morning for 6 days, the \nexposure to atorvastatin was not affected, while Cmax was decreased by 31% and tmax was delayed by \n3.25 hours. \nNo such increase for tmax was observed when atorvastatin was administered in the evening and \nlixisenatide in the morning but the AUC and Cmax of atorvastatin were increased by 27% and 66%, \nrespectively. \nThese changes are not clinically relevant and, therefore, no dose adjustment for atorvastatin is required \nwhen co-administered with lixisenatide. \nWarfarin and other coumarin derivatives \nAfter concomitant administration of warfarin 25 mg with repeated dosing of lixisenatide 20 mcg, there \nwere no effects on AUC or INR (International Normalised Ratio) while Cmax was reduced by 19% and \ntmax was delayed by 7 hours. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for warfarin is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide; however, frequent monitoring of INR in patients on warfarin and/or coumarin derivatives \nis recommended at the time of initiation or ending of lixisenatide treatment. \nDigoxin \nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and digoxin 0.25 mg at steady state, the AUC \nof digoxin was not affected. The tmax of digoxin was delayed by 1.5 hour and the Cmax was reduced by \n26%. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for digoxin is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide. \nRamipril \nAfter concomitant administration of lixisenatide 20 mcg and ramipril 5 mg during 6 days, the AUC of \nramipril was increased by 21% while the Cmax was decreased by 63%. The AUC and Cmax of the active \nmetabolite (ramiprilat) were not affected. The tmax of ramipril and ramiprilat were delayed by \napproximately 2.5 hours. \nBased on these results, no dose adjustment for ramipril is required when co-administered with \nlixisenatide.", "driving": "Women of childbearing potential  \nSuliqua is not recommended in women of childbearing potential not using contraception. \nPregnancy  \nThere is no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies with use of Suliqua, \ninsulin glargine, or lixisenatide.  \nA large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1,000 pregnancy outcomes) with insulin \nglargine indicate no malformative nor feto/neonatal toxicity of insulin glargine. Animal data do not \nindicate reproductive toxicity with insulin glargine.  \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of lixisenatide in pregnant women. Studies with \nlixisenatide in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  \nSuliqua is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using \ncontraception. \nBreast-feeding  \nIt is unknown whether insulin glargine or lixisenatide are excreted in human milk. A risk to the \nnewborns/infants cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with \nSuliqua. \nFertility  \nAnimal studies with lixisenatide or insulin glargine do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect \nto fertility.", "side_effects": "Suliqua has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, the patient's \nability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia or, \nfor example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in situations where these \nabilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). \nPatients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using \nmachines. This is particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning \nsymptoms of hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia.
